the purpura accompany the two foregoing case of sarcoimatosis would seem to find the purpura accompany the two foregoing case of sarcoimatosis explanation in the coexistence of several factor , the main feature be a involvement of the vascular system by the sarcomatous element . there exist in Case I a direct lesion of the vessel wall whereby the sarcoma cell invade directly the various coat , and be find mainly between the intima and the adventitium , dissect they way , as a direct lesion of the vessel wall be , along these tract in the vessel wall . there be further a extensive involvement of the perivascular lymphatic , from which point , indeed , a direct lesion of the vessel wall would seem that the sarcoma cell have invade the wall of the vessel they . in Case II , moreover , not only be there a definite invasion of the lymph space near the vessel they , but , furthermore , there be undoubted evidence of the existence of embolus of sarcoma cell in the lumina of the blood vessel ; and in the immediate vicinity of such condition haemorrhage be invariably find . while some vessel , and indeed a great many , be quite free from such embolus , in other the lumina of the blood vessel be completely occlude by spindle cell , so as to preclude the possibility that a collection of desquamated endothelial cell , such as be frequently find as the result of post-mortem change be merely a collection of desquamated endothelial cell , such as be frequently find as the result of post-mortem change . that such a embolic condition can exist be by no mean a unreasonable supposition , and , while it be generally recognise that multiple sarcoma be usually make up of small round cell , in this case we have a undoubted example of sarcomatosis of the spindle-celled variety . there be numerous instance of this '' embolic purpura , '' as this may be call , especially in french and german literature , the condition be associate with rheumatism , valvular lesion of the heart , and other disease which induce directly or indirectly the formation of such embolus . Krauss , Gimard , Leloir , and other have insist with considerable emphasis on the embolic origin of many purpuric condition , and in some instance Krauss , Gimard , Leloir , have verify Krauss , Gimard , Leloir , observation by histological examination . Leloir assume that , in addition to the presence of the ordinary embolus and the change in the vessel wall with desquamative endarteritis , the blood addition to the presence of the ordinary embolus and the change in the vessel wall with desquamative endarteritis may be much altered chemically , and that in the cachectic condition clot may be throw down from the circulate blood and be carry onward to form capillary embolus , with result haemorrhagic infarction . Krogerer , some ten year ago , in examine the skin remove from patient with symptomatic purpura , find definite thrombose in the smaller vein , and even in the artery . accord to Krogerer view , the alteration in the vessel wall give rise to slow circulation and tendency to thrombosis , bring about a liability to haemorrhage . Krogerer plate bear out Krogerer theory regard the thrombus , many of which show considerable organization . but a careful examination of the purpuric area show further that a mere invasion of the vascular system by sarcoma cell in the lumina of the blood vessel can not explain all the various blood effusion present . on examine the skin remove from patient with symptomatic purpura , for instance , in those area where large irregular haemorrhage have occur , there be but little evidence of vascular invasion , while the ordinary embolus , on the other hand , seem to exist mainly in the localized smaller and more circumscribed patch . one must therefore conclude that in such instance a combination of several factor will alone afford a rational explanation of the purpura accompany the two foregoing case of sarcoimatosis , and that in the general condition of the patient we shall find another cause for the enormous effusion of blood . in both of we the two foregoing case of sarcoimatosis there be high fever , cachexium , and a rapid progressive asthenia , all be the result of a sarcomatosis , and imply also grave alteration in the composition of the blood addition to the presence of the ordinary embolus and the change in the vessel wall with desquamative endarteritis may be much altered chemically , and that in the cachectic condition . from this we may infer a altered condition of the vessel wall , and hence probably a combination of circumstance sufficient to explain the incidence of haemorrhage . the raise cutaneous nodule in we second case , some of which be haemorrhagic , can not be regard as pure sarcomatous metastase , for on microscopic ex

it may be concede that after man have all he present faculty , he do not choose between the adoption of voice and gesture , and never with those faculty , be in a state where the one be use , to the absolute exclusion of the other . the epoch , however , to which we speculation relate be that in which he have not reach the present symmetric development of he intellect and of he bodily organ , and the inquiry be : which mode of communication be earliest adopt to he single want and inform intelligence ? with voice and gesture he could imitate distinictively but few sound of nature , while with gesture he could exhibit action , motion , position , form , dimension , direction and distance , with they derivation and analogue . voice and gesture would seem from this unequal division of capacity that oral speech remain rudimentary long after gesture have become a efficient mode of communication . with due allowance for all purely imitative sound , and for the spontaneous action of vocal organ under excitement , it appear that the connection between idea and word be only to be explain by a compact between speaker and hearer which suppose the existence of a prior mode of communication . this be probably by gesture . at least we may accept this as a clew lead out of the labyrinth of philological confusion , and regulate the immemorial quest of man 's primitive speech . 
I have thus touch , gentleman , upon a few of the many subject that crowd upon the mind for consideration on a occasion like - a few gleanings from a field which be pass rich in promise and possibility , - a few gleanings from a field which be pass rich in promise and possibility . the mind for consideration be a field which be pass rich in promise and possibility that some of we have cultivate for many year , and yet have only scratch the surface ; and , if I have venture to suggest or admonish , the mind for consideration be with the feeling that I own labor in a field which be pass rich in promise and possibility be ere long about to end , and that I may not have another occasion . at no time in the history of the world have there , I trow , be gather together such a body of devoted and capable worker in apply entomology . no time in the history of the world have there mark a era in we call , and , look back at the progress of the past fifteen year , we may well ponder the possibility of the next fifteen . devoted and capable worker in apply entomology will be fruitful of grand result in proportion as we persistently and combinedly pursue the yet unsolved problem , and be not tempt to the immediate presentation of separate fact , which be so innumerable and so easily observe that devoted and capable worker in apply entomology very wealth become a element of weakness . epoch-making discovery result only from this power of follow up unswervingly any give problem or any fixed ideal . the kerosene emulsion ; the cyclone nozzle ; the history of Phylloxera vastatrix , of Phorodon humulus , of Vedalia cardinali , - be illustration in point : and , while we may not expect frequent result as striking or of as wide application as these , there be no end of important problem yet to be solve , and from the solution of which we may look for similar beneficial result . apply entomology be often consider a sordid pursuit ; but apply entomology only become so when the object be sordid . when pursue with unselfish enthusiasm bear of the love of investigation and the delight in benefit we fellow-man , the love of investigation and the delight be inspiring ; and there be few pursuit more deservedly so , consider the vast loss to we farmer from insect injury and the press need that the distressed husbandman have for every aid that can be give bim . we work be elevate in we work sympathy for the struggle and suffering of other . we standard should be high , - the pursuit of knowledge for the advancement of agriculture . no official entomologist should lower we standard by sordid aim . during the recent political campaign the farmer must have be sorely puzzle to know whether the farmer interest need protection or not . on the abstract question of tariff protection to the farmer product , we , as entomologist , may no more agree than do the politician , or than do the farmer the farmer ; but we be a case of protection from in - jurious insect , and upon that there can nowhere be division of opinion . it be we duty to see we be get the abstract question of tariff protection to he product with as little tax for the means as possible . gentleman , I thank you . 
review the floral relation of North America as illustrated in the foregoing instance , we may say that the phenomenon of distribution agree fairly with the record of physical condition which have succeed each other and those which still exist , and upon which we might almost a priori have predict a analogous set of the phenomenon of distribution . in this relationship we may distinguish three category of distribution : -lrb- 1 -rrb- those which still exist due to physical condition of human civilization , commerce , etc. . this have result in place the same species in similar region of coast land of Chile , as , for example , Fagonia cretica in Lower California and Chile ; Munroa squarrosa , western plain of North America , plain of argentine and high plateau of Chile and Bolivia ; coast land of Chile coast land of Chile , coast land of Chile ; Oxytheca dendroidea , lastarricea chilensis , and Chorizanthe comrnmissurali , all in Southern California and Western Chile . -lrb- 2 -rrb- those due to the operation of natural cause act unde present condition of climate , geology , etc. . under this head may be cite such species as sida leprosa , hasta , anomalum , cienfugosium sulphurea , spergulariaplattensis and , in general , element of Gulf zone distribution ; also certain element which still find a pathway along the continental axis , include some alpine and mountain xerophilous genus . -lrb- 3 -rrb- the third category of distribution would include those phenomenon due to geological and climatic change act through long period . under this head be include the element of greatest significance in the relationsip of the North and North America flora . the equally endemic boreal flora of the mexican cordilleras , and genus with sharply distinct species or sub-genus in the arid extra-tropical region of both continent , which may be call remnant element , the equally endemic boreal flora of the mexican cordilleras , and genus with sharply distinct species or sub-genus in the arid extra-tropical region of both continent , which may be call remnant element . 
1 . the basic principle in Mendel 's discovery be                              the basic principle in Mendel 's discovery  the basic principle in Mendel 's discovery the basic principle in Mendel 's discovery the basic principle in Mendel 's discovery . from the basic principle in Mendel 's discovery follow the occurrence in the second and later hybrid generation of a definite number of form in definite numerical proportion . 2 . Mendel 's principle of dominance be realize in the heredity of a considerable number of character among both animal and plant . in accordance with  Mendel 's principle of dominance , hybrid offspring have visibly the character of only one parent or the other , though only one parent or the other transmit those of both parent . 3 . in other case the second and later hybrid have a distinctive character of the second and later hybrid own . this may approximate more or less closely a distinctive character of the second and later hybrid own of one parent or the other , or this may be entirely different from both . frequently the distinctive hybrid character resemble a lose ancestral character . in some case of this sort , as in coat-color of mammal , the distinctive hybrid character probably result from a recomibination of the character see in one or both parent , with certain other character latent -lrb- that be , recessive -rrb- in one parent or the other . 4 . there have be observe the follow exception to  Mendel 's principle of dominance , or to                             the basic principle in Mendel 's discovery  the basic principle in Mendel 's discovery , or to both : -lrb- a -rrb- Mosaic inheritance , in which a pair of character ordinarily relate as dominant and recessive occur in a balanced relationship , side by side in the hybrid individual and frequently in  Mendel 's principle of dominance                              the basic principle in Mendel 's discovery  the basic principle in Mendel 's discovery also . this balanced condition , once obtain , be usually stable under close breeding , but be readily disturb by cross-breeding , give place then to the normal dominance . -lrb- b -rrb- stable -lrb- self-perpetuating -rrb- hybrid form result from certain cross . these constitute a exception to both the law of dominance and to                              the basic principle in Mendel 's discovery  the basic principle in Mendel 's discovery . for the second and later hybrid be like neither parent , but neither parent exist in a stable union in the mature germcell produce by the second and later hybrid . -lrb- c -rrb- coupling , i. e. , complete correlation may exist between two or more character , so that two or more character form a compound unit not separable in heredity , at least in certain cross . -lrb- d -rrb- disintegration of character apparently simple may take place in consequence of cross-breeding . -lrb- e -rrb- departure from the expected ratio of dominant to recessive may be explain in some case as due to inferior vigor , and so greater mortality , on the part of dominant to recessive respectively . -lrb- f -rrb- case of apparent reversal of dominance may arise from ` false hybridization ' -lrb- induce lparthenogenesis -rrb- . possibly in other case the determination of dominance rest with circumstance as yet unknown . 5 . Mendel 's principle strengthen the view that species arise by discontinuous variation . they explain why new type be especially variable , how one variation cause other , and why certain variation be so persistent in other the occurrence in the second and later hybrid . 
the following fact be the following fact . that many origin of new character be through some internal action in heredity . 2 . that many important adaptive character arise determinately , definitely , but by extremely slow stage . 3 . that degree of similarity in that such origin correspond with that degree of kinship . 4 . that degree of kinship also affect to a certain extent , but not absolutely the time of appearance , or the time of the origin , or the rate of evolution . 5 . that such origin find expression not sponta . neously , or irrespective of condition , or from purely internal mechanical cause , but through some entirely unknown and at present inconceivable relation to ontogeny -lrb- habit and use -rrb- , to environment -lrb- external condition -rrb- , and to selection . 6 . that if such origin do spring from internal hereditary principle , as they appear to do in many ease , slow origin -lrb- mutation of de Vries -rrb- may be simply due to the same law operating with a different velocity . 
1 . in tuberculosis meningitis there be a tuberculosis endarteritis characterize by the formation of intimal tubercle and a diffuse subendothelial , intimal proliferation due to implantation of tubercle bacilus from the blood . from a tuberculosis endarteritis characterize by the formation of intimal tubercle and a diffuse subendothelial , intimal proliferation due to implantation of tubercle bacilus from the blood the infiltration may spread into the muscular coat and the adventitium , and the whole wall may undergo caseous and hyaline degeneration . 2 . tuberculous proliferation in the adventitium may invade the media and the intima , and the whole wall of the arterial segment may undergo degeneration . 3 . the vein be constantly the seat of more or less extensive infiltration , which always result from adjacent extravascular or arterial focus . 4 . the epithelioid cell of the subendothelial , tuberculous intimal see pdf for structure proliferation be most likely derive from the subendothelial layer of connective tissue and not from the endothelial lining . 
the toxin cubic centimetre develop in suitable bouillon , contain in ordinary Erlenmeyer flask , within a period of twenty-four hour . in such boullon the toxin reach the toxin greatest strength in from four to seven day -lrb- 0.005 cubic centimetre kill a 500-gramme guinea-pig in   -rrb- . this period of time cover that of the greatest growth of the bacillus , as show both by the appearance of the culture and by the number of colony develop a agar plate . the body of the diphtheria bacilus do not at any time contain toxin in cosiderable amount . the type of growth of the diphtheria bacilus and the rapidity and extent of the production of toxin depend more on the reaction of the bouillon than upon any other single factor . the best result be obtain in bouillon which , after be neutralize to litmus , have about seven cubic centimetre of normal soda solution add to each litre . a excessive amount of either acid or alkali prevent the development of toxin . strong toxin be produce in bouillon contain peptone range from one to ten per cent . the strength of  the toxin average greater in the two and four-per-cent peptone solution than in the one-percent . when the stage of acid reaction be brief and the degree of acidity probably slight , strong toxin develop while the culture bouillon be still acid ; but when the stage of acid reaction be prolong , little if any toxin be produce until just before the fluid become alkaline . glucose be deleterious to the growth of the diphtheria the bacillus and to the production of toxin when it be present in sufficient amount to cause by the growth of the diphtheria the bacillus disintegration too great a degree of acidity in the fluid culture . when the acid result from decomposition of glucose be neutralize by the addition of alkali the diphtheria bacilus again grow abundantly . glucose be not present , at least as a rule , in sufficient amount in the meat as obtain from the New York butcher to prevent the rapid production of strong toxin if the bouillon be make sufficiently alkaline . in we experiment , when other condition be similar , the strength of the toxin be in proportion to the virulence and vigour of the growth of the diphtheria the bacillus employ . 
the most important of this investigation have be the most important of this investigation , by means of which numerous error attend the use of the instrument have be eliminate . the result of the work show that all olfactory sensation , so far as they produce any effect through the vasomotor system , tend to diminish the volume of the arm , and therefore presumably cause a congestion of the brain . Whenever the stimulation occassion a increase in the arm , as sometimes happen , it seem to be due to acceleration of the heart rate , which , of course , tend also to increase the supply of blood to the brain . the of odour vary in extent with different individual , and with the same individual at different time . the of odour be most marked in subject sensitive to odour . irritant vapours , such as formic acid , have a marked effect in the same direction-that be , subject sensitive to odour cause a strong diminution in the arm . the experiment give no support to the view that pleasant sensation be accompany by a diminution of the See PDF for structure blood supply to the brain and unpleasant sensation by the reverse efeect . in all my experiment mental work cause a marked and prolonged diminution in the arm . this vasomotor effect be sometimes precede by a transitory increase in the volume of the arm cause by the heart rate . 
the pigmentary granule of the negro 's skin and hair can be free in several way from the cell in which they be lodge and collect in any desire amount . as thus obtain , the pigmentary granule of the negro 's skin and hair be find to be insoluble in dilute alkali , dilute hydrochloric acid -lrb- hot or cold -rrb- , alcohol , or other organic solvent when apply in the order name . if , after alkali have be subject to the action of dilute hydrochloric acid , alkali be again treat with dilute alkali , alkali be find to give up alkali pigment , and , on the continue application of heat , the pigmentary granule of the negro 's skin and hair dissolve entirely in the alkaline solution , leave only a insignificant residue . the pigmentary granule of the negro 's skin and hair be compose of a colourless ground substance or substratum , alkali pigment , and much inorganic matter . alkali inorganic constituent , as thus far determine , be calcium , magnesium , iron , and silicic , phosphoric , and sulphuric acid ; and alkali inorganic constituent possibly play a important part in the deposition and fixation of the colour matter in the pigmentary granule of the negro 's skin and hair . the isolate pigment , contain only the merest trace of iron-so little , in fact , that we more probable must think of the isolate pigment when entirely pure as free of iron . heating the isolate pigment with barium hydrate at a temperature of 260 degree c. entirely free heating the isolate pigment with barium hydrate at a temperature of 260 degree c. from the closely adherent ground substance , and it be then find that the vapours of pyrrol be no longer emit when heating the isolate pigment with barium hydrate at a temperature of 260 degree c. be subject to dry distillation , and the odour of burnt feather be no longer discern , although nitrogen be still present . we more probable can not conclude as the result of we more probable work that the isolate pigment be the isolate pigment ; it seem to we more probable that the result of we more probable work be ultimately derive from the proteid of the parenchymatous juice . the total quantity of soluble pigment in the skin of a negro of average size be find to weigh about 1 gramme ; the weight of the pigmentary granule of the negro 's skin and hair be about 3.3 gramme , if we more probable be right in we more probable assumption that the proteid of the parenchymatous juice contain sixty-five per cent of water and five per cent of mineral constituent in the proteid of the parenchymatous juice natural state in the epidermis . the pigment of the epidermis and hair of the negro 's be very likely identical . in the present state of we more probable knowledge we more probable can only say that it seem highly probable that the pigment of the negro 's hair be not different from the dark pigment find in the hair of the white race , and we more probable may infer that the pigment of the black skin differ only in amount and not in kind from that deposit in the skin of the white man . 
the deduction that MAY be DRAWN FROM the result of THESE experiment be as follow : that the normal vital resistance of rabbit to infection by streptococcus pyogene -lrb- erysipelato -rrb- be markedly diminish through the influence of alcohol when give daily to the stage of acute intoxication . that a similar , though by no means so conspicuous , diminution of resistance to infection and intoxication by the bacillus coli communis also occur in rabbit subject to the same influence . and no means , while in alcoholized rabbit inoculate in various way with staphylococcus pyogene aureus , individual instance of lowered resistance be observe , still it be impossible to say from these experiment that in general a marked difference be notice between alcoholized and non-alcoholized animal as regard infection by this particular organism . it be interesting to note that the result of inoculation of alcoholized rabbit with the erysipelas coccus correspond in a way with clinical observation on human being addict to the excessive use of alcohol when infect by this particular organism . in the course of the work a effort be make to determine if , through the oxidation of alcohol in the tissue to acid of the corresponding chemical group , the increase of susceptibility could be refer to a diminution in the alkalinity of the blood as a result of the presence of such acid . the number of experiment thus far make on this point be too small to justify dogmatic statement , but from what we have gather there be but little evidence in support of this view . throughout THESE experiment , with few exception , it will be see that alcoholized and non-alcoholized animal not only show the effect of the inoculation earlier than do the non-alcoholized rabbit , but in the case of the streptococcus inoculation the lesion produce -lrb- formation of miliary abscess -rrb- be much more pronounced than be those that usually follow inoculation with this particular organism . with the result of structural alteration consequent upon its direct action on  the tissue , one be constrain to believe that the result of structural alteration consequent upon its direct action on  the tissue be in most case the result of structural alteration consequent upon the result of structural alteration consequent upon its direct action on  the tissue direct action on the tissue , though in a number of the animal no such alteration could be make out by macroscopic examination . I be inclined , however , to the belief , in the light of the work of Berkley and of Friedenwald , do under the direction of Prof. Welch , in the pathological laboratory of the Johns Hopkina University , that a closer study of the tissue of alcoholized and non-alcoholized animal would have reveal in all of they structural change of such a nature as to indicate disturbance of important vital function of sufficient gravity to fully account for the loss of normal resistance . the conspicuous influence of the alcohol on the gastric mucous membrane in many of alcoholized and non-alcoholized animal , with the consequent disturbance of nutrition , be undoubtedly the conspicuous influence of the alcohol on the gastric mucous membrane in many of  alcoholized and non-alcoholized animal , with the consequent disturbance of nutrition . in the light of the work of Berkley the susceptibility induce by alcohol to excess be somewhat analogous to that induce by starvation , where we see the resistance of alcoholized and non-alcoholized animal to particular form of infection very markedly diminish . 
the glander nodule in the class of case study by we be in no sense analogous to the miliary tubercle in no sense histogenesis , and we study afford no support to Baumgarten 's view . the primary effect of the bacillus of glander on a tissue we find to be not a production of epithelioid cell , which undergo necrosis and invasion by leucocyte , as happen in the case in which the bacillus of tuberculosis be concern , but to be the production of primary necrosis of a tissue , follow by inflammatory exudation , often of a suppurative character . degenerative change rapidly ensue in the inflammatory product . these conclusion be in harmony with the observation of Tedeschi , above refer to .

the result obtain in the precede experiment MAY be BRIEFLY summarize as follow : 1 . Nucleohiston do not protect against the tetanus toxin , diphtheria toxin , hog-cholera bacillus , or anthrax bacillus . 2 . mixture of nucleohiston and either the tetanus toxin or diphtheria toxin lose they specific toxic action-the latter much more rapidly than the former . animal that recover after inoculation of such mixture be not render immune . 3 . in a mixture of nucleohiston and anthrax bacillus the latter be unaffected , even after the lapse of eleven day . 4 . the destruction of specific toxin in a solution of nucleohiston , though in part due to sodium carbonate , be probably chiefly due to nucleohiston and anthrax . 5 . Histon do not protect against the tetanus toxin diphtheria toxin bacillus anthrax bacillus . 6 . in a mixture of histon and diphtheria toxin the latter be destroy in a few minute . this action be in part , if not wholly , due to the acidity of the histon solution . similar mixture of closely related body , similar mixture of closely related body similar mixture of closely related body , in Witte 's pepton , give analogous result . the animal that recover from such inoculation be not render immune . Histon do not destroy the tetanus toxin as readily as histon and diphtheria toxin . 7 . Histon possess decide and mark toxic property which be not due to the hydrochloric acid present . 
I . the mean total time take from 450 experiment on sixteen subject be find to be 0.0420 second . II . natural wink occur very shortly before the record be take have no influence . III . the reflex time be find to vary in different individual , the limit of the mean time be 0.0351 and 0.0491 second . for any give individual there be a close correspondence between average of set of experiment obtain under similar condition . in the case of one man this be true of set of experiment take a year apart . sex have no influence . iv . apprehension seem to shorten the reflex time . 
the conclusion which have BEEN reach by the series of experiment record in the present memoir be : First . lower arterial pressure have a comparatively feeble effect upon the respiration , but when the pressure fall sufficiently , respiratory depression do occur . second . even excessive lowering of blood pressure primarily stimulate the vaso-motor centre , the vaso-motor centre . third .  the vaso-motor centre recover  the vaso-motor centre more slowly after profound etherization than after a like chloroform narcosis . fourth . it be possible for ether as well as chloroform to produce death some hour after the cessation of some hour administration , at a time when the cerebrum have long free the cerebrum from distinct evidence of the narcotic , so that consciousness and intellectual action have be restore . in apply the conclusion which have BEEN reach by the series of experiment record in the present memoir to a factor in the production of respiratory failure it be evident that the depression of the circulation produce by chloroform have effect upon the respiratory centre only when the pressure have fall very low , and whilst a factor in the production of respiratory failure may be a factor in the production of respiratory failure during chloroformization , the failure must be chiefly due to the direct influence exercise by the drug upon the respiratory centre only when  the pressure have fall very low . clinical experience show that nausea and general depression be more pronounced after the use of ether than after the use of chloroform , a difference which be strongly insist upon by the advocate of chloroform as a important agent in favor of that anaesthetic . we research confirm clinical observation , and experimentally show that the depression of the circulation produce by ether be more permanent than that cause by chloroform ; the reason probably be the large amount of ether which be necessary to produce profound narcosis , with lowering of the arterial pressure ; a amount so large that the depression of the circulation produce by ether can neither be burn up in the system nor yet eliminate in the time which would be necessary for the much smaller amount of chloroform to be get rid of after chloroformization . 
the experiment describe in part iv of this paper show that in whatever manner the problem of the relation of the vagus to the accelerator be approach , whether the accelerator be stimulate during a stimulation of the vagus to the accelerator , or the vagus during a stimulation of the accelerator , or both be stimulate simultaneously , either for a short or for a longer period , the same , viz. be the same , viz. , the effect upon the rate of the heart be determine entirely by the relative strength of the stimulus apply to the two nerve . if the stimulus apply to the two nerve be of approximately the same strength , as judge by the effect of stimulate the two nerve separately , the rate of the heart be but slightly affect ; if the stimulus apply to the vagus be the stronger , the heart be slow ; if the effect of stimulate  the two nerve separately be weaker , the heart be accelerate . in all case approximately the algebraic sum of the result of stimulate they separately simultaneously be approximately the algebraic sum of the result of stimulate they separately ; sometimes the inhibitory effect slightly predominate , but not more frequently than do the accelerator effect . moreover , the two nerve may be stimulate simultaneously for a considerable period of time without either completely overcome the effect of the other . thus as far as they effect upon the rate of the ventricular beat be concern , the vagus and accelerator nerve seem to be purely antagonistic ; the statement that a minimal stimulation of the one can completely overcome a maximal stimulation of the other be undoubtedly incorrect , and the hypothesis as to the mode of action of these nerve upon the heart , base upon the statement that a minimal stimulation of the one can completely overcome a maximal stimulation of  the other , lose they chief support . 
Colostrum corpuscle be not always find in so-called colostrum milk ; when they be present , the percentage of proteid be higher ; as they disappear , the proteid percentage drop . the color of colostrum milk be yellow ; the color of colostrum milk be especially mark in negro ' milk -lrb- observe in four case not include in this report -rrb- . the reaction of colostrum milk be alkaline . the specific gravity vary from 1024 to 1034 . this variation be chiefly due to the variation in the amount of fat present . 
in sum up the contents of the precede page it may be state that the action of digitali have be divide into two stage accord to the change evince by the ventricle under the action of digitali influence ; of these the first be characterize by marked inhibitory action together with modification of the cardiac muscle , while in the second the inhibitory action be less marked and the muscular action become the more prominent feature . the inhibitory action be due to direct stimulation by this series of the pneumogastric centrally in the medullum oblonga and peripherally in the heart . the extent to which the inhibitory mechanism be stimulate vary in different animal and with different member of the digitali series . the muscular action of small quantity betray the muscular action of small quantity in a tendency to increase the extent of the contraction , while in some case the degree of relaxation reach in diastole be also lessen by the degree of relaxation reach in diastole . in larger quantity the digitali series increase the irritability of the cardiac muscle very considerably , and the spontaneous rhythm of the ventricle therefore become developed . through the interaction of these two factor in the the first stage the rhythm of the whole heart be slow , the contraction of the ventricle be more complete , and the diastolic relaxation be generally increase , although the diastolic relaxation may be unchanged or lessen . the systolic pressure be increase and the fall from maximum to minimum pressure be slower than normal owing to the increase completeness and longer duration of systole -lrb- Rolleston -rrb- . the auricle generally contract with less force and may relax more completely than normally . sometimes , however , the auricle contraction also be more complete than before the injection of the drug . this latter condition generally precede the diminution of the force of the auricular contraction . this variation of the effect of digitali in the auricle explain the change evince by the ventricle under the action of digitali influence in intra-auricular pressure note by Kaufmann . the contraction volume of the ventricle be always much increase , and the output per unit of time be generally augmented , and this together with the contraction of the peripheral arteriole cause a increase in the tension in the systemic circulation , a acceleration of the systemic circulation , and possibly a temporary increase in the pressure in the great vein and in the auricle and ventricle in diastole -lrb- kaufmann -rrb- . the pressure in the pulmonary artery be practically unaffected by some member of the digitali series , while by other the pressure in the pulmonary artery be considerably increase . this difference in the reaction of the pulmonary circulation be due to the vary extent to which these drug act on the peripheral artery and not to any difference in some member of  the digitali series the muscular action of small quantity on the two side of the heart . if the inhibitory action be very strongly mark the slowing of the heart may be extreme , the ventricle assume some member of  the digitali series own spontaneous rhythm and all connection with the auricle be lose . while the contraction volume of the ventricle be still greater than normal , some member of  the digitali series unit of time may become less than normal , the aortic tension therefore fall and the rapidity of the systemic circulation be lessen . the ventricle maintain some member of  the digitali series association throughout , and probably the rhythm of the two auricle also remain equal . the ventricular rhythm , however , become irregular owing to the variation in the duration of the diastolic pause . the auricle may cease altogether in diastole , or may continue to beat with a slower or faster rhythm than the ventricle . during the the second stage the rhythm of the whole heart become accelerated owing to the increase irritability of the heart muscle . the ventricle tend to assume a rapid spontaneous rhythm , while the auricular rhythm be also quicker than in the the first stage . when these two rhythm interfere by the passage of impulse across the auriculo-ventricular boundary in either direction , irregularity of the heart be produce , generally bear a distinctly periodic character . the ventricle continue to maintain they common rhythm , while the auricle and ventricle may contract at quite different rate . the two ventrus 
from our observation I think the follow proposition be justified : -lrb- 1 -rrb- all muscular movement be make up of a series of elementarycontraction and relaxation in alternation , which may be appreciable as tremor in condition of both health and disease . -lrb- 2 -rrb- the difference between different tremor be of degree rather than of kind , i. e. no one form of tremor be distinctive of any one disease or group of disease . -lrb- 3 -rrb- no definite relation exist between one form of tremor and any other . -lrb- 4 -rrb- the frequency of movement be in inverse ratio to the amplitnde and vice versâ . -lrb- 5 -rrb- habitual movement be perform with greater freedom from tremor than unusual movement . -lrb- 6 -rrb- there be no material difference between the movement of the two side of the body , except as related to proposition -lrb- 5 -rrb- . 
the conclusion at which WE ARRIVE be the following : 1 . nodular enlargement of the tube can be cause by a number of different pathological condition . 2 . clinical examination do not enable we to make a diagnosis of the pathological condition exist in a individual case of nodule of the tube . 3 . the diagnosis of the nature of a tubal nodule can be make only with the microscope . 4 . the condition cause nodular enlargement of the tube be congenital or acquire , non-inflammatory or inflammatory . 5 . any one of these condition can exist without the production of the nodule . 6 . the nodule can be find in all part of the tube and-taking the peculiar anatomy of each part of the tube into account-show the same structure . 7 . the enlargement can be cause by epithelial or epithelioid formation , connective or muscular tissue , by round-cell infiltration or combination of two or more of these . 8 . epithelial or epithelioid formation originate in the epithelium of a. the tubal mucous membrane -lrb- salpingitis pseudo-folliculari , salpingitis pseudo-folliculari -rrb- . b. the accessory tube -lrb- intraparietal parasalpinx and hydro-parasalpinx -rrb- . c. remnant of the wolffian body -lrb- adenomyoma -rrb- . 9 . epithelial or epithelioid formation , connective or muscular tissue originate in the peritoneal endothelium -lrb- peritoneal growth under `` relative heterotopy '' -rrb- . 10 . a consequence of inflammatory condition of the tubal wall -lrb- salpingitis interstitiali , Zweifel -rrb- be a consequence of inflammatory condition of the tubal wall -lrb- salpingitis interstitiali , Zweifel -rrb- . 11 . the hypertrophy of the muscular tissue be a. non-inflammatory -lrb- adenomyoma -rrb- . b. consequent upon inflammation-kaltenbach 's case -lrb- 23 -rrb- . 12 . the accumulation of round cell be direct evidence of inflammation : a. non-specific -lrb- salpingitis interstitiali dissemina , salpingitis absceden -rrb- ; or b. consequent upon inflammation-kaltenbach 's case -lrb- 23 -rrb- . specific -lrb- salpingitis tuberculosa or s. gonorrhoica -rrb- . 13 . epithelial or epithelioid formation , connective or muscular tissue can occur wherever pseudo-membrane cover organ line with a serous coat . 14 . extra-uterine pregnancy -lrb- abdominal or tubal -rrb- produce epithelial or epithelioid formation , connective or muscular tissue by cause pseudo-membrane to form-not by any irritation peculiar to the pregnancy . 
1 . the cause of the rhythmic contraction of the ventricle the cause of the rhythmic contraction of the ventricle lie within the ventricle the cause of the rhythmic contraction of the ventricle . 2 . a single , localized , co-ordination centre be not a single , localized , co-ordination centre ; the co-ordination mechanism , whatever the co-ordination mechanism may be , be present in all part of the ventricle the cause of the rhythmic contraction of the ventricle . 3 . the integrity of the whole ventricle be not essential to the coordinate contraction of a part of the ventricle the cause of the rhythmic contraction of the ventricle . 4 . the apex of the mammalian heart possess spontaneous , rhythmic contractility . 5 . assume that the general belief in the absence of nerve cell from the apical part of the ventricle the cause of the rhythmic contraction of the ventricle be correct , these experiment demonstrate that nerve cell from the apical part of  the ventricle the cause of the rhythmic contraction of the ventricle be not essential to spontaneous , long-continued , co-ordinated contraction of the ventricle the cause of the rhythmic contraction of the ventricle . 
1 . the claim of L. Pfeiffer that small granular amoeboid body be present in the blood of vaccinate child and calf , and in the blood from case of variolum , during the stage of fever be confirm . a nucleus have not be positively make out in any of small granular amoeboid body . 2 . small granular amoeboid body , have a diameter about one-third that of a red blood cell , appear , also , in the blood of the monkey during the active stage of vaccinia and disappear with the decline of the local inflammation . 3 . a body of like appearance , granulation and size may occasionally be find in the normal blood of monkey and child . 4 . Pale amoeboid body , contain a few dark pigment-like granule , be present in case of variolum and in the blood of the variolate monkey . body of like appearance may occasionally be find in the blood of vaccinate child and monkey . 
assume bacillus , as cause by a increase of indol formation and the typical typhoid bacillus to represent the type of this group that present the greatest divergence in biological peculiarity , we conclude , as other also have do , that there be a series of closely related form that may be regard as intermediate or transitional and which serve to establish a biological relationship , either near or remote , between these two typical member . from we own study we be incline to regard the typical colon bacillus , as cause by a increase of indol formation bacillus , as cause by a increase of indol formation as the type of this group that present the greatest divergence in biological peculiarity , for the reason that the typical colon bacillus , as cause by a increase of indol formation functional equilibrium , as observe in the intestine , be so permanent a quality that a quality may readily be perpetuate under what be ordinarily regard as favorable artificial circumstance , and that with the continuance of such condition there be no conspicuous tendency on the part of this organism to deviate from what we regard as the continuance of such condition norm ; whereas , on the other hand , with all the other member of this group with which we have work , there be not only a lack of uniformity in the adjustment of the function , but such as exist be readily disturb under artificial environment ; though the other hand must be bear in mind that even with bacillus , as cause by a increase of indol formation we have also show functional modification to be possible under particular condition . when the member of the colon group be cultivate under circumstance favorable to the development of both the function of fermentation and that of proteolysis , fermentation invariably take precedence and no evidence of proteolysis be manifest until after fermentation have cease . the cultivation of all the member of the colon group under circumstance that favor the development of one function , viz . that of proteolysis , at the expense of another , viz . that of fermentation , result first in a apparent increase of vigor ; but this be of temporary duration and be quickly follow by the decline and death of the cell . the formation of much larger amount of indol by typical colon culture be the formation of much larger amount of indol by typical colon culture than have ever be obtain by we by any other method . by the method of experimentation through which we be enable to accentuate the proteolytic activity of the typical colon bacillus , as cause by a increase of indol formation , as cause by a increase of the formation of much larger amount of indol by typical colon culture , we have also induce the function of the formation of much larger amount of indol by typical colon culture not only in atypical colon bacillus that have be devoid of the method of experimentation through which we be enable to accentuate the proteolytic activity of the typical colon bacillus , as cause by a increase of indol formation , as cause by a increase of  the formation of much larger amount of indol by typical colon culture , but in every specimen of typical typhoid bacillus to which we have access as well . we feel justified in regard one of the differential test between the typical typhoid bacillus and bacillus , as cause by a increase of indol formation , as cause by a increase of indol formation the typical colon bacillus , as cause by a increase of indol formation that of the formation of much larger amount of indol by typical colon culture on the part of the latter and the absence of the function of  the formation of much larger amount of indol by typical colon culture from the former , as of questionable value , for the reason that the typical colon bacillus , as cause by a increase of indol formation functional equilibrium , as observe in the intestine , be so permanent a quality that it may readily be perpetuate under what be ordinarily regard as favorable artificial circumstance , and that with the continuance of such condition there be no conspicuous tendency on the part of this organism to deviate from what we regard as its norm , as show above , that by particular method of cultivation indol production have be show to accompany the development of a number of specimen that we have every reason to regard as genuine typhoid bacillus . as a result of we own experiment , together with the observation of other , there can be no doubt that the bacillus coli communis at time possess pathogenic property , and that by artificial method of treatment the bacillus coli communis at time may often be bring from a condition of benignity to one of virulence . the spleen of a typhoid patient have always be regard as the only trustworthy source from which to obtain the typical typhoid bacillus . while we believe this to be true , still we investigation show that other member of the colon group may also be present in this viscus ; in fact , from such spleen we have isolate practically all of the variety of we this group with which we have work . from we experience , the value of the serum test for the differentiation of typhoid and colon bacillus would seem to be questionable . we be inclined , however , to attribute the irregularity record above as due more to the method of application than to defect of the principle involve ; for , as state , by the use of dry blood , as in we own experiment , it be not possible to make the serum test for the differentiation of typhoid and colon bacillus with constant and accurate , or even approximately accurat 
the action of aconitin on the dog 's heart , therefore , seem to consist in : 1 . a stimulation of the inhibitory mechanism , especially of the centre in the medullum oblonga . 2 . a increase in the irritability of the muscle of the auricle and the ventricle , which lead to independent contraction of one or both of these division and culminate in fibrillary contraction in the ventricle . the first of these be the first of these , and aconitin may , therefore , be consider to be indicate when it be desirable to stimulate the inhibitory centre without act on the heart muscle . of course the first of these have a further effect on the circulation through the stimulation of the vaso-motor centre , but this would appear to be of minor importance . 
the result and conclusion of the above investigation be : 1 . the term glio-sarcoma should be drop , as unscientific and misleading in the term glio-sarcoma significance . 2 . the problem regard neuroglia demand vary method for they adequate study . 3 . with all the means at we command , the absolute determination of the relation of cell and fibre in individual case remain difficult and at time impossible . 4 . no criterion have yet be offer to determine a fundamental distinction between glioma and sarcoma -lrb- stroebe -rrb- ; and secondly , between glioma and so-called gliosis -lrb- weigert -rrb- . 5 . the development of neuroglium in all probability be from cell with protoplasmic process to cell with differentiate and independent fibre . 6 . herein lie a possible reconciliation of the conflicting view concern the ultimate structure of human neuroglium . 
1 . 1 must be accept from a comparison between the histological change describe in the focal necrose due to abrin and ricin , diphtheria , eclampsium , blood-serum intoxication , typhoid fever , lobar pneumonia and abrin and ricin , and those describe here in the three case of tuberculosis , that the last be also the last . 2 . it may be claim that the area of necrosis in the three case of tuberculosis have the focal necrose due to abrin and ricin , diphtheria , eclampsium , blood-serum intoxication , typhoid fever , lobar pneumonia and glander origin in ischaemia , for the reason that the focal necrose due to abrin and ricin , diphtheria , eclampsium , blood-serum intoxication , typhoid fever , lobar pneumonia and glander be numerous in the spleen and be not find in the kidney . against such a explanation of the focal necrose due to abrin and ricin , diphtheria , eclampsium , blood-serum intoxication , typhoid fever , lobar pneumonia and glander causation be the fact : that other form of necrosis affect frequently the spleen and seldom the kidney ; that thrombosis of vessel or any fixed relation of the area in the spleen to blood-vessel could not be establish ; that the tubercle bacillus be invariably present ; and lastly and of no slight importance , that the focal necrose due to abrin and ricin , diphtheria , eclampsium , blood-serum intoxication , typhoid fever , lobar pneumonia and glander be all present in case of marked marasmus . 3 . that necrosis in the three case of tuberculosis might be the area of necrosis in the three case of tuberculosis be possible , but no group , colony or even single body could be find which answer to the requirement in shape or staining property for such bacterium . even be necrosis in the three case of tuberculosis the case that the histological lesion of a septicaemia occur as a complication of tuberculosis be the histological lesion of a septicaemia occur as a complication of tuberculosis , the presence of the bacillus of tuberculosis in the area of necrosis in the three case of tuberculosis would still require explanation . 4 . lastly , it be not unreasonable to suppose that a diminish resistance on the part of the tissue incidental to marasmus be a diminish resistance on the part of the tissue incidental to marasmus . 
semi-solid culture media , and more especially semi-solid culture media render semi-solid by temperature of from 30 degree to 40 degree c. , seem to have a important bearing in the differentiation of bacterial species , particularly bacterial species present various degree of motility . in such media not only the effect of difference in consistence on the motility of a organism may be note , but the effect produce by various chemical and nutrient ingredient on the growth and motility may be readily observe . by systematically vary the constituent of such media only the effect of difference in consistence on the motility of a organism have be possible to produce a medium in which the behavior of bacillus typhosus differentiate the behavior of bacillus typhosus from the various member of the colon group ; and also to produce a medium in which the colony of bacillus typhosus assume a form which distinguish the various member of the colon group from the colony of the colon bacillus in plate culture . bacillus typhosus alone of all the organism investigate during these experiment have display both the power of give rise to thread-forming colony in the plating medium and that of the uniform clouding of the tube medium , hence these two character may prove to be of great value in the identification of a organism . the practical application of the use of such media have lead to the ready detection of bacillus typhosus and the practical application of the use of  such media isolation from the stool of patient suffer from typhoid fever . no suspect water have be subject to test , but from the investigation of artificially infected tap-water such media here describe may be assume to have a application in the detection of bacillus typhosus in such water . 
1 . the proteid consist of albumin and globulin , albumin and globulin . and .2592 grm . in the 24 hour , but usually between .7 and .37 grm. , the average be .5317 grm . 2 . the quantity of the proteid vary directly as the urea , inversely as the external temperature . the relation between the quantity of urine and the quantity of proteid be not constant . the quantity of the proteida be little affect by diuretic ; the quantity of the proteida tend to be increase by certain drug that act upon the circulation . the quantity of the proteida be lessen during sleep . it be apt to suffer a sudden temporary increase , return as suddenly to the usual average . for this phenomenon we have no explanation . 3 . from .5449 to .6616 grm . of coagulable proteid a day -lrb- .0079 to .0094 grm . per kilo of body-weight -rrb- may be excrete through the urine for a indefinite time by a otherwise healthy individual without damage to either kidney or organism . 
from the foregoing description of the histological change in the leptomeninx it be quite evident that we be deal with a chronic , stationary , healing form of tuberculous inflammation . this statement be substantiate , in the first place , by the clinical history . the only reasonable interpretation of the symptom would establish the duration of the process as four month . the imaginable contingency that there exist first a meningeal syphilitic lesion that be disperse by the iodide of potassium only to be follow by a tuberculous infection be so remote and unlikely that the imaginable contingency that there exist first a meningeal syphilitic lesion that be disperse by the iodide of potassium only to be follow by a tuberculous infection need not be discuss . at all event the tuberculous leptomeningitis , which present a typical distribution , begin insidiously , exist at time in a latent condition , and pursue a very anomalous course , mark by a relative mildness of all the symptom , and thus the tuberculous leptomeningitis come about a relative mildness of all the symptom when a apparent or real improvement follow the administration of iodide of potassium able observer be induce to make a erroneous diagnosis . death occur as a result of a intercurrent infection . the long duration of the process be also show , anatomically , by the thick layer of firm , translucent and gelatinous material that mat together the structure at the base , and also by the evident adhesion between the pium and the brain . the histological examination furnish proof positive of the correctness of the conclusion in regard to the peculiar character of the process because the correctness of the conclusion in regard show : -lrb- 1 -rrb- that the tuberculous proliferation be uniform in development and have reach nearly the same stage of evolution throughout the entire extent of the leptomeninx involve ; it be not a process that have advance by exacerbation and irregular extension ; the lesion be , generally speak , of nearly the same age everywhere and must have begin at about the same time . -lrb- 2 -rrb- that only a very limited degree of caseous degeneration be present , point to a early arrest of the activity of the tubercle bacillus or to a very decide diminution or attenuation of a early arrest of the activity of the tubercle bacillus virulence . -lrb- 3 -rrb- that the subendothelial intimal proliferation of epithelioid cell , so generally find in acute tuberculous leptomeningitis , * have in this case become more or less completely change into distinct fibrous tissue in 3 but very slight , if any , direct evidence of 3 tuberculous origin can be find . 3 be only by recognize that the chronic endarteritis be most marked in correspondence with the most advanced adventitial tuberculous change , and by find a imperfect , much altered giant cell in one district of intimal thickening , that we be able to establish the direct kinship of the endovascular change with those of the pium in general . -lrb- 4 -rrb- that acute inflammatory change , in a chronic , stationary , healing form of tuberculous inflammation of emigration of polymorphonuclear leucocyte and of fibrinous exudation , be entirely absent in all part of the district involve . the presence of a turbid serous fluid be a very anomalous course not at all inconsistent with the view that the anatomical change be of long duration . -lrb- 5 -rrb- that the granulation tissue present be , in general , undergo fibrillation and contain a rich supply of enabryonal capillary vessel as well as of larger blood-vessel of evidently new formation . the absence of any considerable extent of polymorphonuclear leucocytic infiltration in the granulation tissue present have already be refer to . the cell in the granulation tissue present correspond to the cell of embryonal or formative connective tissue . Vacuolation be rarely present . -lrb- 6 -rrb- that the unusually large number of giant cell present be remarkably free from evidence of necrosis and degeneration of the character ordinarily observe in the subendothelial intimal proliferation of epithelioid cell , so generally find in acute tuberculous leptomeningitis , * have in this case become more or less , that they do not contain in demonstrable form tubercle bacillus , and that the majority of the giant cell seem to be separate into individual cell and smaller mass often with , but sometimes also without , evidence of nuclear disintegration . the possibility that these phenomenon may signify fusion instead of the sundering of the giant cell will be discuss below . for these reason there can be no doubt that th 
the case report , in this article be one of a somewhat extensive cutaneous disease , which occur in a man , 33 year of age , who give the following history : the disease when first examine first make the disease when first examine appearance , eleven and a half year ago , at the back of the left ear , as a pimple which soon become pustular . the process extend forward , very slowly and gradually encroach upon and cover almost the entire face , almost the entire face . another similar lesion occur , one month after the primary invasion , on the back of the hand , which heal in about four year , after treatment with caustic . a third lesion appear on the right side of the scrotum -lrb- six month after -rrb- , which increase in size for a year and then heal spontaneously . a fourth inoculation appear , on the anterior surface of the left thigh just above the internal condyle , and grow for a year , after which a fourth inoculation gradually heal spontaneously . a fifth lesion appear on the back of the neck and also heal spontaneously after grow for a year . the disease when first examine present many of the feature of a lupus vulgari . there be no enlarged lymphatic gland and the patient 's health have always be good . the family and personal history reveal no syphilitic or tuberculous taint . the section show the presence of what appear to be bud blastomycete . the section also present pathological feature similar to those see in the first case record by Gilchrist ; in many section almost typical tubercle be find . the organism in the tissue be chiefly spherical , unicellular body vary from 10-20 micro in diameter , and consist of a doubly contoured membrane , which enclose a fine granular protoplasm with sometimes a vacuole . many budding form in various stage be find ; nonucleus could be demonstrate , neither be any mycelium or hypha present in the tissue . the parasite be almost always find outside of cell , comparatively few be enclose in giant cell . pure culture of the organism be obtain directly from the cutaneous lesion in two place from the pus squeeze out from between the papillomatous variety of a fifth lesion . the organism grow on all ordinary media , and especially well on potato and beer-wort agar . pure culture of the organism show both many budding form in various stage and a fairly profuse mycelium . older culture , carry through many generation , produce sometimes little or a fairly profuse mycelium . round , ovoid , doubly contoured , refractive body be round , ovoid , doubly contoured , refractive body , vary in size from about 10 to 20micro in diameter . a fairly profuse mycelium be , on rare occasion , of two variety , very fine and also coarse with sessile bud and conidium . dog , a horse , a sheep and guinea-pig be successfully inoculate , the most striking result be these nodule , grossly simulate tumor , in the lung . microscopically these nodule be of a chronic inflammatory nature and contain numerous parasite identical in appearance with those in the patient 's . in the tissue of none of the animal successfully inoculate be any mycelium find . since the organism do not ferment sugar and produce in culture mycelium , the organism may either belong to bud blastomycete or to the oidium , but in conformity with prevail nomenclature regard the organism as a blastomyce . shall term the disease which have be produce by this organism blastomycetic dermatitis . give the name blastomyce dermatitidi to the parasite which have isolate and describe in this paper . in close be of the opinion that it would be advisable to examine more carefully all tuberculous lesion of the skin , and especially those of tuberculosis verrucosa cuti , for bud blastomycete . this can be readily and rapidly do by soak the unstained section in ordinary liquor potassse , when the organism if present will stand out as round , ovoid , doubly contoured , refractive body . 
from the result of the various experiment already detailed I feel justified in draw the follow conclusion : -lrb- 1 -rrb- absolutely fresh thyroid gland be not poisonous , in the usual sense of the term , when absorb through the alimentary canal . -lrb- 2 -rrb- the symptom of induce thyroidism be                the symptom of induce thyroidism                 the symptom of induce thyroidism              the symptom of induce thyroidism . -lrb- 3 -rrb- the so-called experimental thyroidism be not specific for absolutely fresh thyroid only , for the ingestion of many substance derive from animal tissue other than the thyroid gland may produce a intoxication strikingly similar in every respect to that of experimental thyroidism . -lrb- 4 -rrb- most , if not all , animal animal tissue other than the thyroid gland yield substance which , if inject in large quantity directly into the circulation or beneath the skin , will produce a intoxication often very similar to that produce by injection of various substance derive from the fresh thyroid tissue . -lrb- 5 -rrb- the effect result from the intravascular or subcutaneous injection of aqueous extract , the intravascular or subcutaneous injection and the intravascular or subcutaneous injection the intravascular or subcutaneous injection be by no means necessarily indicative of the function and the action of the hypothetical internal secretion of the same tissue during life . -lrb- 6 -rrb- the utilization of the fact that the ingestion of many substance derive from animal tissue other than the thyroid gland decompose                 the symptom of induce thyroidism                              the symptom of induce thyroidism              the symptom of induce thyroidism produce on certain occasion a intoxication with certain symptom similar to some of those of g-rave ' disease be not justifiable for the furtherance of the theory that the symptom of exophthalmic goitre result from a over-production of the thyroid secretion . -lrb- 7 -rrb- the result of the various experiment already detailed lead to conclude with Drechsel that the fresh thyroid tissue yield at least probably two substance two be capable of palliate the symptom of the acute cachexium in totally thyroidless dog . -lrb- 8 -rrb-        also yield one and probably two substance two be as equally capable as the thyroid extractive of palliate the acute cachexium in totally thyroidless dog in totally thyroidless dog . -lrb- 9 -rrb- a enzyme be a enzyme , nor do either contain iodine . -lrb- 10 -rrb- neither the feeding of minced raw thyroid gland , nor the injection of aqueous thyroid extract , the intravascular or subcutaneous injection , and concentrate solution of the extract palliative thyroid principle be capable of keep totally thyroidless young dog alive longer than a few week -lrb- possibly three week -rrb- . the thyroid preparation contain decomposition product be the thyroid preparation contain decomposition product . -lrb- 11 -rrb- the presence of one , or usually several , small accessory thyroid body , which gradually hypertrophy and wholly or partially assume the function of the excise thyroid lobe , several , small accessory thyroid body , which gradually hypertrophy and wholly or partially assume the function of the excise thyroid lobe . -lrb- 12 -rrb- totally totally thyroidless young dog alive longer be so quickly overwhelm by the acute cachexium in totally thyroidless dog , and the interval between the thyroidectomy and the onset of the severe dyspnoeic attack and subsequent death differ so slightly , no matter which of the usual variety of fresh food be employ , that kind of fresh food can not be unquestionably affirm to influence the onset of the cachexium in any especially definite manner . animal food , in which constituent poisonous to rabbit have develop , probably slightly hasten the onset of the severer symptom , and the vaunted remarkably modify influence of a diet of ordinary milk , such as breisacher observe , do not exist in the case of the totally thyroidless dog . -lrb- 13 -rrb- monkey whose general metabolism be disturb in consequence of the removal of a greater portion of the thyroid gland , evidently become more susceptible to those constituent of meat that be poisonous to rabbit , and sufficient clinical evidence exist for conclude that probably a like susceptibility to animal food contain such constituent also exist in man when the function of the thyroid gland be sufficiently disturb . -lrb- 14 -rrb- and , finally , as regard the thyroid factor in the pathology of exophthalmic goitre , I agree with gley that 
my experiment lead my to believe that complete occlusion of the small intestine at its lower end will give rise to the occurrence of cholin , neurin and perhaps other basis , provide the food take contain any considerable quantity of lecithin . it be not improbable that still other poison be form by bacterial action from other constituent of the food in case of intestinal obstruction , before surgical means be resort to , namely , wash out the stomach and as much of the gut as possible . while cholin would have to be absorb in relatively large amount to exert a marked toxic action in human being a marked toxic action be otherwise with neurin , which be many time more intense in a marked toxic action a marked toxic action and must be class with the exceedingly active poison . a marked toxic action have be show both by the experiment of Schmidt and Weiss and also by those record in this paper that the highly poisonous neurin may be form from cholin by bacterium . in a marked toxic action physiological action neurin agree closely with muscarin ; especially to be note here be the paralytic action on the heart and the heart power to increase the intestinal movement to such a extent that continual evacuation occur . whether the ptomaine which be find by my be poisonous 1 can not yet say . the ptomaine which be find by my must be consider prove , however , that highly toxic substance may arise in the intestinal canal during the intestinal canal complete occlusion . the method of treat case of intestinal obstruction , before surgical means be resort to , namely , wash out the stomach and as much of the gut as possible often reduce the violent paristalsis and this be due , perhaps , to the removal of highly toxic substance out of which irritating and toxic product be form by bacterium . in conclusion , my would remark that we knowledge of the fate of the lecithin be very deficient . the assumption that it be saponify by the fat-splitting enzyme of the pancreatic juice , thus yield cholin , glycero-phosphoric acid and fatty acid , rest on the work of Bókai in 1877 and , as that investigator that investigator admit , without exclude bacterial action . this omission throw grave doubt on the result . if my purpose in the near future to examine this question with the help of modern method be correct , caution must be observe in the use of some food that have be consider most nutritious and healthful ; for instance , the ingestion of a meal make up largely of egg would hardly be without danger because of the poisonous action of the large quantity of cholin liberate from the lecithin and the probability of the formation of the highly poisonous neurin . my purpose in the near future to examine this question with the help of modern method be my purpose in the near future to examine this question with the help of modern method . 
-lrb- 1 -rrb- there be a transitory glycosurium in diphtheria , which be find frequently in the severe case and be usually present in the fatal one . -lrb- 2 -rrb- a transitory glycosurium in diphtheria , which be find frequently in the severe case and be usually present in the fatal one be often associate with albuminurium . -lrb- 3 -rrb- injection of diphtheria antitoxin be occasionally follow for a few day by a slight glycosurium . 
the FOLLOWING GENERAL conclusion MAY be DRAWN FROM the precede work : Fibrin be alter by formaldehyde and be then less easily digest by pepsin and by trypsin . Papaïn be apparently unable to digest fibrin even when this be expose to very weak formaldehyde -lrb- 1:1000 -rrb- for a very short time . the casein of milk , on contact with formaldehyde , undergo rapid alteration and be as a result not coagulate by rennet , or but very slowly . such altered casein , like similar fibrin , be not readily digest by the proteolytic ferment . the longer very weak formaldehyde -lrb- 1:1000 -rrb- act on casein and on fibrin the more marked be the more marked . Pepsin be not affect by a one per cent solution of formaldehyde , even when the mixture have stand for four week . even a five per cent solution of formaldehyde act for three week have no effect on pepsin . contrary result obtain by other be due to a alteration of similar fibrin by very weak formaldehyde -lrb- 1:1000 -rrb- . a putrid solution of pepsin in distilled water one month old digest fibrin as readily as a fresh solution . Rennet be not affect even by a four per cent solution of formaldehyde act for several week . the absence of coagulation at time be due to the action of a very on the casein of milk , on contact with formaldehyde and not on the rennet ferment . Papaïn be very quickly alter by formaldehyde , even in very dilute solution . moreover , it be unable to digest fibrin that have be expose to the action of a very dilute the solution . trypsin be alter by formaldehyde to such a extent that digestion of fibrin will not take place , or but very slowly . the extent to which trypsin be affect by formaldehyde depend largely upon the amount of organic matter present , as well as on the amount of ferment in the solution . Amylopsin be not destroy by very dilute solution of formaldehyde , but stronger solution decrease the activity of the rennet ferment , and if use in sufficient concentration will destroy the activity of  the rennet ferment completely . Ptyalin , like the diastatic ferment of the pancreas , be not destroy by dilute solution of formaldehyde . if the latter be use in rather strong concentration and allow to act for some time the latter will destroy the rennet ferment . the action of a very be more rapid and more marked at a slightly elevated temperature than at ordinary room temperature . malt diastase , unlike the diastatic ferment of the saliva and pancreatic solution , be not destroy by formaldehyde when this be use in moderate amount and at ordinary temperature . unlike pepsin , a solution of malt diastase readily undergo decomposition on stand even for one or more day . this destruction be undoubtedly due to bacterium since this destruction do not take place when formaldehyde be present . consequently the favor action which formaldehyde apparently exert on diastase really consist in the inhibition of the growth of micro-organism , and hence malt diastase be protect against decomposition . 
-lrb- 1 -rrb- a acute gonorrhoeal urethritis may be a acute gonorrhoeal urethritis . -lrb- 2 -rrb- these infection may be mixed or secondary , due to the entrance into the circulation of organism other than the gonococcus , or they may be purely gonococcal in nature . -lrb- 3 -rrb- endocarditis be a occasional complication of gonorrhoea . -lrb- 4 -rrb- this endocarditis may be transient , disappear with but few apparent result , or 4 may leave the patient with a chronic valvular lesion , or 4 may pursue a rapidly fatal course with the symptom of acute ulcerative endocarditis . -lrb- 5 -rrb- the endocarditis associate with gonorrhoea be commonly due to the direct action of the gonococcus , hut may be the result of a secondary or mixed infection . -lrb- 6 -rrb- Pericarditis may also occur as a complication of gonorrhoea , but 6 be less frequent than endocarditis . the result of a secondary or mixed infection may , as in the case of the latter , be the result of a secondary or mixed infection either of a pure gonococcal or of a mixed infection . -lrb- 7 -rrb- grave myocardial change , embolic abscess , purulent infiltration , embolic abscess be common in the severe gonococcal septicaemia . -lrb- 8 -rrb- in instance of gonococcal septicaemia the diagnosis may , in some case , be make during life by culture take from the circulate blood accord to proper method . 
1 . I have simplify the dilution method by use a stock glycerine emulsion of the virulent cord , from which the desire dilution can be readily prepare . the proportion of glycerine should not exceed -lrb- 1/5 -rrb- part , if it be desire to retain the full virulence of a stock glycerine emulsion of the virulent cord , from which the desire dilution can be readily prepare . 2 . there be some danger of give rabies to animal in the dilution immunization treatment , the dilution immunization treatment . 3 . the dried-cord method do not rest solely upon the principle of dilution , but be base also upon attenuation of the virus . 4 . the Pasteur method be entirely free from the element of danger which pertain to the glycerine dilution method and rest upon a sounder experimental basis be the one to be prefer . 
-lrb- 1 -rrb- the application of the nissl method to the study of the motor cell of the spinal cord , and the nerve cell of the dorsal root ganglion in typhoid fever , show that the motor cell of the spinal cord regularly suffer pathological change in the course of the infection . -lrb- 2 -rrb- the alteration in the motor cell , the new formation begin about the nucleus and extend through the protoplasm be more constant and of a severer grade than be the alteration in the motor cell be more constant and of a severer grade than . the more characteristic change consist of disintegration , solution and destruction of the chromatic substance of the cell start from the axone hillock and proceeding toward the nucleus . coincidently the nucleus of the affected cell seek the periphery . the alteration in the motor cell be more constant and of a severer grade than be also suffer by the nucleus and nucleolus . -lrb- 3 -rrb- while the prevail type of pathological change be the prevail type of pathological change , disintegration , etc. , of the nissl body situate in the periphery of the cell and in the dendrite be also observe -lrb- peripheral chromatolysis -rrb- . -lrb- 4 -rrb- in experimental infection with typhoid bacillus in rabbit a similar series of lesion in the corresponding nerve cell in the spinal cord and ganglion be encounter . -lrb- 5 -rrb- the main or central type of lesion discover be identical with that find in man and animal after section , destruction , or even slight injury of the peripheral nerve . -lrb- 6 -rrb- the examination of the peripheral nerve arise from the lumbar segment of the cord -lrb- the site in man and rabbit of the most profound change -rrb- in rabbit a similar series of lesion in the corresponding nerve cell in the spinal cord and ganglion be encounter inoculate with typhoid bacillus in rabbit a similar series of lesion in the corresponding nerve cell in the spinal cord and ganglion be encounter show well-marked evidence of parenchymatous degeneration . -lrb- 7 > it be probable that lesion of the peripheral nerve in typhoid fever in human being be common and that the post-typhoid hyper sthesia and paralysis be due to this cause . -lrb- 8 -rrb- restitution of the chromatic granule may take place in the affect nerve cell , the new formation begin about the nucleus and extend through the protoplasm , the new formation begin about the nucleus and extend through the protoplasm . 
1 . tubercle bacillus when suspend in . distilled water , normal salt solution , bouillon and milk , be destroy at 60 degree c. in 15 to 20 minute . the larger number be destroy in 5 to 10 minute . 2 . when tubercle bacillus be suspend in milk , the pellicle which form during the exposure at 60 degree c. may contain live bacillus after 60 minute . 
1 . as vary amount of the calcium oxalate may be hold in solution in the urine , conclusion base upon the presence or number of calcium oxalate crystal find therein be of no real value as a indication of the quantity of oxalic acid present . 2 . unless the utmost care be exercise , the result obtain by quantitative estimation of oxalic acid be subject to large percentage of error . this be especially true in the use of Neubauer 's or Shultzen 's method , in which the calcium oxalate be precipitate in a alkaline solution . 3 . a ordinary mixed diet regularly contain trace of oxalic acid or a ordinary mixed diet salt . 4 . a portion of the oxalic acid ingest with the food may be absorb and reappear unchanged in the urine . 5 . the normal daily excretion of oxalic acid in the urine fluctuate with the amount take in the food , and vary from a few milligramme to two or three centigramme , be usually below ten milligramme . 6 . in health , the oxalic acid ingest with the food , or only a trace , be form in the body , but that present in the urine have be ingest with the food . 7 . in certain clinical disturbance which in some of the case study above be associate with absence of free hydrochloric acid from the gastric juice , oxalic acid be form in the organism . 8 . this formation in the organism be connect with fermentative activity in the alimentary canal . -lrb- a -rrb- the prolonged feeding of dog with excessive quantity of glucose , together with meat , lead eventually to a state of oxalurium . -lrb- 6 -rrb- this experimental oxalurium be associate with a mucous gastritis , and with absence of free hydrochloric acid in the gastric contents . -lrb- c -rrb- this experimental oxalurium be associate with a mucous gastritis , and with absence of free hydrochloric acid in the gastric contents and the accompany gastritis be referable to fermentation induce by the excessive feed with sugar . -lrb- d -rrb- the experimental gastritis from fermentation be associate with the formation of oxalic acid in the gastric contents . 9 . the symptom attribute to a oxalic acid diathesis , with the exception of those due to local irritation in the genitourinary tract , do not appear to be due to the presence in the system of soluble oxalate , but be more likely to depend on other product of fermentation and putrefaction . 
the result of the forego experiment MAY be BRIEFLY summarize as follow : the amount of antitoxic substance obtain by precipitation with magnesium sulphate from the blood-serum of the horse correspond , as nearly as can be determine by the use of test guinea-pig , in full to the protective power of the serum from which nearly as be obtain , i. e. the precipitate from 1 cc . the serum from which nearly as be obtain , i. e. the precipitate from 1 will protect against the same amount of toxin as 1 cc . of the serum from which nearly as be obtain , i. e. the precipitate from 1 . Equal amount of the precipitate by magnesium sulphate from immunize and non-immunized horse act differently toward toxin ; i. e. the proportion of protective substance to the precipitate from non-immunized serum be exceedingly small as compare with the proportion of antitoxin to the precipitate from the serum of immunize immunize and non-immunized horse . the average precipitate from the serum of immunize immunize and non-immunized horse , as obtain by magnesium sulphate , be more abundant than the average precipitate from serum of immunize and non-immunized horse . in the case of the same animal before and after immunization , the serum before immunization give a less abundant precipitate with magnesium sulphate than the serum test after immunization . the proportion of increase per unit of antitoxic strength for the same or different horse be not constant . this may be due to a increase of inactive substance -lrb- in they relation to diphtheric toxin -rrb- or to imperfect method of determination . the precipitate obtain by magnesium sulphate give all the reaction recognize as characteristic of globulin , and as distinguish the from other albuminous body . we be not warrant , then , in the present state of we knowledge , in consider any part of these precipitate as other than globulin . but the present state of we knowledge do seem warrantable to conclude , from the fact that the globulin of normal serum do not protect , or only in comparatively large amount , against diphtheric toxin , that new globulin be form , or rather greatly increase in the serum of immunize immunize and non-immunized horse , and that the globulin of normal serum protect against the toxin . these increase globulin and the inert globulin -lrb- which from obvious cause be a very variable factor -rrb- be both precipitate by magnesium sulphate . every animal have a physiological and pathological history more or less widely diverge from the normal , hence absolute conformity in the result of the forego experiment MAY be BRIEFLY summarize as follow : the amount of antitoxic substance obtain by precipitation with magnesium sulphate from the blood-serum of the horse be not to be expect , at least with we present method of differentiation . 
1 . the globulin of both normal and diphtheria antitoxic serum exhibit chemically toward reagent the same reaction , be precipitate by magnesium sulphate and split up into fraction in precisely the same way . 2 . all of the diphtheric antitoxic power of both normal and immunized serum be always carry by the globulin and both normal and immunized serum fractional precipitate . 3 . during the fractional precipitation of the serum globulin of horse immunize from diphtheria toxin and horse not immunize from diphtheria toxin , some of the globulin be lose , likewise at the same time some of the antitoxic power of the serum globulin of horse immunize from diphtheria toxin and horse not immunize from diphtheria toxin be lose . 4 . the same reaction , consider in connection with the fact that different observer as well as some of  the globulin have find diphtheric antitoxic power in normal horse 's serum and that this antitoxin separate with the globulin , strongly incline some of  the globulin to consider `` diphtheria antitoxin '' a form of globulin . 5 .  the same reaction , consider in connection with the fact that different observer as well as  some of  the globulin have find diphtheric antitoxic power in normal horse 's serum and that this antitoxin separate with  the globulin , previously separate from both normal and immunized serum by magnesium sulphate , with sodium chloride lead one to think that there be a formation of globulin salt . 6 . since serum albumin in a magnesium sulphate solution give both normal and immunized serum fractional precipitate at definite temperature , it seem not improbable that serum albumin in a magnesium sulphate solution be precipitate in the form of albumin salt . 
in the case report in this article there be septicaemia with special localization of the microorganism in the brain , with gas cyst of the brain and general gaseous emphysema due to bacillus mucosus capsulatus -lrb- aërogenes group -rrb- . the bacillus isolate from the organ of the case report in this article , as well as other member of     other member of the aërogenic group of bacillus mucosus capsulatus can cause general gaseous emphysema in the cadaver of rabbit , either with or without the intravenous injection of sugar before the animal be kill , the gas , however , be most abundant and rapidly form in the former case . it be not impossible that some of the publish case of gaseous emphysema in which a bacteriological examination be not make , may have be due to other member of the aërogenic group of bacillus mucosus capsulatus . 
the result obtain in THIS study MAY be BRIEFLY SUMMARIZED : 1 . these acid-resisting bacillus be find in many of the lower animal , more especially the horse , cow , dog , guinea-pig and white rat . in the case of the rabbit and cat no such organism be detect . 2 . many of these acid-resisting bacillus resemble the tubercle bacillus and the smegma bacillus of man . 3 . the acid-resisting organism be undoubtedly of different species and there be good reason to believe that the term smegma the tubercle bacillus denote not a definite species but rather a group of bacillus have common staining property . 
the epidemic we have observe , be due to the presence and growth in the frog of bacillus hydrophilus fuscus . this be prove by recover the bacillus in pure culture from the body fluid of frog sick or dead of the disease , and the inoculation of apparently healthy frog ; and , finally , by recover the bacillus in pure culture from frog inoculate and sick or die as a result of the inoculation of healthy frog with a emulsion of the pure culture , and by obtain the same clinical picture and pathological finding as in the original diseased frog . the disease be widely distribute throughout North America and Europe , and in this country and Canada be know as `` red-leg . '' the disease have be observe by we chiefly in the warm weather of September and October . the disease be characterize by congestion of the ventral surface of the body , with more or less ulceration in , and haemorrhage beneath , the skin , which seem to be the usual portal of entry of the infection , and lower resistance from heat and from anaemia , bloat due to serous exudation into the lymph sac , gradual failure to respond to stimulus , which symptom be follow by coma and death , coma and death . after death haemorrhage into the muscle and degenerative change in the muscle , spleen , liver , and , to a slight degree , in the intestinal tract , be find . the presence of numerous isolate red-cell nucleus show a advanced degree of anaemia and leucocytosis . predispose cause of the disease be predispose cause of  the disease . by a series of controlled experiment with inoculate frog sick or dead of the disease , and the inoculation of healthy frog with a emulsion of the pure culture , and by obtain the same clinical picture and pathological finding as in the original diseased frog ; and , finally , by recover     the bacillus in pure culture from frog inoculate and sick we have show that , while temperature a little above freezing have no harmful effect upon frog sick or dead of the disease , and the inoculation of healthy frog with a emulsion of the pure culture , and by obtain the same clinical picture and pathological finding as in the original diseased frog ; and , finally , by recover     the bacillus in pure culture from frog inoculate and sick , death haemorrhage into the muscle completely control all manifestation of the disease in frog sick or dead of the disease , and the inoculation of healthy frog with a emulsion of the pure culture , and by obtain the same clinical picture and pathological finding as in the original diseased frog ; and , finally , by recover     the bacillus in pure culture from frog inoculate and sick , if frog sick or dead of the disease , and the inoculation of healthy frog with a emulsion of the pure culture , and by obtain the same clinical picture and pathological finding as in the original diseased frog ; and , finally , by recover     the bacillus in pure culture from frog inoculate and sick be leave in the cold for a period as long as seven day ; and , further , that even short period in the cold chamber will bring about a delay of the fatal result in diseased or inoculate frog sick or dead of the disease , and the inoculation of healthy frog with a emulsion of the pure culture , and by obtain the same clinical picture and pathological finding as in the original diseased frog ; and , finally , by recover     the bacillus in pure culture from frog inoculate and sick . the anaemia so often find in apparently healthy frog seem in many case to be due to the presence in the lung of the frog of the Distomum cylindraceum , the Distomum cylindraceum , which , occur in sufficiently large number in a individual frog , be capable of materially diminish the available supply of red corpuscle . severe laking of the presence of numerous isolate red-cell nucleus , the presence of numerous isolate red-cell nucleus , and great diminution in the number , or almost total absence of the red cell in frog sick or dead of the disease , and the inoculation of healthy frog with a emulsion of the pure culture , and by obtain the same clinical picture and pathological finding as in the original diseased frog ; and , finally , by recover     the bacillus in pure culture from frog inoculate and sick , be in proportion to the severity of the infection and due to bacterial action . the presence of the haematozoan parasite , the haematozoan parasite , do not play any part as a predisposing or exciting cause of the disease . the ascarid rhabdomena nigrovenosum , although frequently present as a parasite in the lung of frog sick or dead of the disease , and the inoculation of healthy frog with a emulsion of the pure culture , and by obtain the same clinical picture and pathological finding as in the original diseased frog ; and , finally , by recover     the bacillus in pure culture from frog inoculate and sick , play no part in cause or promote the disease . 
-lrb- 1 -rrb- the cytotoxin be not specific . -lrb- 2 -rrb- the change occur after the injection of different cytotoxin be similar and do not vary in kind . -lrb- 3 -rrb- the change occur after the injection of different cytotoxin do , however , vary in degree in the one have the most marked effect be place first , etc. : -lrb- a -rrb- haemolymphotoxin , -lrb- b -rrb- splenotoxin , -lrb- c -rrb- lymphotoxin , -lrb- d -rrb- endotheliotoxin , -lrb- e -rrb- nephrotoxin , -lrb- f -rrb- hepatotoxin , the one have the most marked effect be place first , etc. : -lrb- a -rrb- haemolymphotoxin , -lrb- b -rrb- splenotoxin , -lrb- c -rrb- lymphotoxin , -lrb- d -rrb- endotheliotoxin , -lrb- e -rrb- nephrotoxin , -lrb- f -rrb- hepatotoxin . -lrb- 4 -rrb- nephrotoxin cause the most specific change . -lrb- 5 -rrb- the haemolymph gland play some important part in the production of eosinophile . the haemolytic action of haemolymphotoxic serum be greater than that of other cytotoxic serum . -lrb- 6 -rrb- the histological change which be observe in every case be secondary to the haemolytic factor present in all cytotoxic serum . 
1 . better result in the production of diphtheria antitoxin can be obtain with greater experience in the selection of the most suitable type of horse to be use . young animal be usually to be prefer . over one-half of all such horse can be make to yield 300-unit serum , while a third will yield -lrb- 5 -rrb- oo-unit serum . 2 . high-test horse require a shorter time to immunize and will yield a potent serum for a longer period than will low-test horse . 3 . the period of usefulness of a antitoxin horse be short , and on a average endure only a few month . 4 . a horse have attain a maximal antitoxic height begin to suffer a decline in antitoxin , which be usually as rapid as the ascent have be , and be unaffected by subsequent injection of diphtheria toxin . 
wash blood corpuscle of certain species of animal in a concentration of about -lrb- 5 -rrb- per cent suspend in salt solution contain above 4 per cent of cobra venom undergo change in they resistance to certain physical and chemical agent . they become non-haemolyzable by water , ether , saponin , and quite strong solution of lecithin , provide always that the excess of venom have not be entirely remove . on the other hand , certain acid and alkali , except ammonia , lake the venomize blood corpuscle of certain species of animal more easily than they lake normal corpuscle . venom solution of 2 per cent and less exert no protective property upon blood corpuscle of certain species of animal , but they induce change in they resistance in blood corpuscle of certain species of animal whereby they be render more easily lake by the same physical and chemical agent . 
the reparative process which follow the wide spread necrosis of the dog 's liver cause by the injection of haemagglutinative serum constitute a chronic interstitial hepatitis of definite and constant character . a new type of experimental hepatic lesion be not only a new type of experimental hepatic lesion , but be more definitely a cirrhosis than be any other experimental lesion hitherto describe . a new type of experimental hepatic lesion be of importance in explain the histogenesis of cirrhosis , and incidentally various repair process in the dog 's liver cause by the injection of haemagglutinative serum ; but a new type of experimental hepatic lesion do not aid in the elucidation of the etiology of cirrhosis in man , nor do a new type of experimental hepatic lesion explain the peculiar arrangement of the new connective tissue in any form of human cirrhosis except possibly that associate with chronic passive congestion . a new type of experimental hepatic lesion definitely demonstrate , however , that cirrhosis may follow extensive primary destructive lesion , a view not yet fully accept , and support the contention of Kretz that cirrhosis be essentially a reparative process . 
the fact collect in the third part of THIS PAPER JUSTIFY the follow conclusion : -lrb- 1 -rrb- all of the cardinal symptom of stokes-adams disease may be duplicate by which heart-block , and by this alone . -lrb- 2 -rrb- no typical case of stokes-adams disease have be describe in which heart-block might not have be the cause of the trouble . -lrb- 3 -rrb- it can be show that all case of stokes-adams disease which have be study by sufficiently accurate method be case of heart-block . -lrb- 4 -rrb- 4 would appear that heart-block without and with syncopal attack be two stage of the same disease process . 
since the haemolysin of the several venom respond differently to photodynamic action , the haemolysin of the several venom may be regard as possess different chemical constitution . as regard stability , cobra haemolysin rank first , daboium second , and Crotalus third . the toxicity of all the venom be more or less diminish by eosin and erythrosin in sunlight . this reduction in toxicity depend upon chemical change , of more or less profound nature , take place in certain of the active principle of the venom . the more stabile the predominant active principle the less this reduction in toxicity , and vice versa . venom-neurotoxin be highly resistant to photodynamic action , venom-haemolysin be less resistant , while the haemorrhagin and thrombokinase of Crotalus and daboia venom exhibit weak power of resistance to the haemorrhagin and thrombokinase of Crotalus and daboia venom action . hence it follow that while cobra venom remain almost unaltered , rattlesnake and daboium venom be greatly reduce in toxicity when mix with the fluorescent dye and expose to sunlight . there be a interesting parallel between the action of eosin and erythrosin in sunlight upon the different venom and the different venom reaction to other injurious agency . for example , the haemolysin of cobra and daboium venom be more heat resistant than the haemolysin of crotalus venom , and the former be less injure by the fluorescent dye than the latter . the neurotoxin of the former venom be also more heat stabile than that of the rattlesnake , and the same relative degree of resistance hold for this substance and the aniline . just as the haemorrhagin of rattlesnake venom and the thrombokinase of daboium venom be destroy by a temperature of 75 degree c. , so be the haemorrhagin of rattlesnake venom and the thrombokinase of daboium venom . the globulin-precipitating and blood corpuscle-protecting principle of cobra venom be relatively thermostabile and in contradistinction to the immunity-precipitin contradistinction to the immunity-precipitin be also unaffected by eosin and erythrosin in sunlight . this study of the action of photodynamic substance upon snake venom serve again to bring out the fact of snake venom highly complex nature , and while enlarge somewhat the field in which photodynamic activity be know to operate , somewhat the field in which photodynamic activity be know to operate also prove that this form of destructive activity be affect by the same condition of resistance as confront the action of the usual physical and chemical agent . 
the first be interrupt for period of three to eighty-one minute by ligation of the innominate and leave subclavian artery proximal to the origin of the vertebral , in ninety-three cat . eleven dog be use in the earlier experiment . the eye reflex disappear very quickly and a period of high blood pressure follow the occlusion immediately ; vagus inhibition cause cardiac slowing and a fall in the blood pressure , follow by a second rise after the vagus center succumb to anaemia . respiration stop temporarily -lrb- twenty to sixty seconds -rrb- after the beginning of occlusion , and then follow a series of strong gasp of the Cheyne-Stokes type , after which twenty to sixty seconds stop until some time after the restoration of the first . the respiratory and vagus center lose they power of function at approximately the same time . asphyxial slowing of the heart may occur without the agency of the vagus center . the blood pressure slowly fall to a level which be maintain throughout the remainder of the period of occlusion . the anterior part of the cord and the encephalon lose all function ; the eye reflex be obtainable . the reflex of the posterior part of the cord persist ; the intravenous injection of strychnine do not affect the anterior part of the cord and the encephalon during the period of occlusion ; but do affect the posterior portion of the cord . there be no secretion of tear or saliva , and the intra-ocular pressure be reduce . the blood pressure fall still more after release of the cerebrum artery , but soon begin to rise . two to sixty minute after restoration of    the first   the first gasp be a strong one , two to sixty minute after restoration of  the first the first gasp be a strong one . the rate gradually increase until rapid enough for natural respiration . the eye reflex and intra-ocular tension return more gradually , ten minute to three hour after restoration of    the first   the first . the anterior part of the cord and the encephalon recover the anterior part of the cord and the encephalon function gradually . the  the first reflex occur only on the same side as the stimulus , cross of the  the first reflex , to involve the other side , not occur till later . as a rule , all reflex return , and a short period of quiet follow . the anterior part of the cord and the encephalon again become irritable to strychnine , but succumb to the anterior part of the cord and the encephalon action before the normal part . the spasm , of tonic , clonic , or mixed type , then appear , terminate in -lrb- a -rrb- death , -lrb- b -rrb- partial or -lrb- c -rrb- complete recovery . in partial recovery , disturbance of locomotion , such as walk in a circle , paralysis , dementia , loss of sight , hearing , and general intelligence , characterize the post-convulsive period . after complete recovery , there be a return to normal deportment . no gross lesion of the nervous system , other than a congested appearance of the previously anaemic area , be observe . transection of the spinal cord stop the spasm below the level of section . hemisection of the cord stop the spasm on the same side as the stimulus , below the level of section . death , without any return of the reflex after release of the cerebral artery , have follow a occlusion of seven and one-half minute . respiration have return after a occlusion of one hour . five animal have recover completely after a occlusion of seven minute or more . only one animal have recover completely after a occlusion of fifteen minute . only one animal have recover completely after a occlusion of twenty minute . in Herzen 's -lrb- 26 -rrb- resuscitation of a animal after several hour of cerebral anaemia , there must have be some anastomotic channel to the brain . Mayer 's -lrb- 27 -rrb- limit of ten to fifteen minute of cerebral anaemia , beyond which resuscitation be not practicable , be close to the correct one . -lrb- 27 -rrb- limit appear to we that , in case of resuscitation two hour after cessation of the heart-beat , -lrb- Prus. , loc.cit . -rrb- the auricle must have keep up a slow but , in some degree , a efficient movement of the blood through the brain . the truth of this suggestion might be test by introduce some easily recognize , non-diffusible substance into a vein after the heart-beat cease to affect a manometer , and later search for i 
1 . in a patient with typhoid fever , who have take , during eleven day , 132 gramme of lactate of calcium by the mouth , as well as 5 gramme of calcium chloride , there develop , eleven day after a large abscess of the breast from which bacillus typhosus and staphylococcus aureus be obtain on culture , a large abscess of the breast from which bacillus typhosus and staphylococcus aureus be obtain on culture . a large abscess of the breast from which bacillus typhosus and staphylococcus aureus be obtain on culture be open and the wound pack with iodoform gauze . eleven day later a deposit of calcium appear in the granulation tissue border the wound . this rapidly increase until the rim of the opening and the lining granulation tissue be convert into a hard , calcareous mass . a number of nodule of a apparently similar character appear in other part of the breast from which bacillus typhosus and staphylococcus aureus be obtain on culture . 2 . a month later the iodoform packing be remove and a patient with typhoid fever , who have take , during eleven day , 132 gramme of lactate of calcium by the mouth , as well as 5 gramme of chloride of calcium subcutaneously be put on a carbohydrate free diet . this be continue for twenty-four of the next thirty-six day . under this treatment a large abscess of the breast from which bacillus typhosus and staphylococcus aureus be obtain on culture almost entirely heal with complete disappearance of a deposit of calcium . 3 . study of the intake and output of calcium show that , during three day under a diet of milk and egg there be a material calcium retention -lrb- this .346 132 gramme of lactate of calcium -rrb- : -lrb- b -rrb- that during two period amount to three week in all , under a carbohydrate free diet , there be a excess of ca elimination over the intake of 3.672 gramme , -lrb- c -rrb- that during ten day follow the last carbohydrate free period , under a normal diet , there be a retention of calcium amounting to 0.602 gramme . 4 . the disappearance of calcium from the breast from which bacillus typhosus and staphylococcus aureus be obtain on culture be associate in time with a carbohydrate free diet and the excessive elimination of calcium . 3 . under a carbohydrate free diet acetone and diacetic acid appear on two occasion in the urine , but be not accompany by any increase in the excessive elimination of calcium . 6 . with regard to the cause of the calcification , we can not speak with certainty . the remarkable association of the deposition of calcium at the seat of a injection of calcium chloride in a individual who have be receive large quantity of lactate of calcium by the mouth-a deposition occur in tissue which be in direct connection with or in the immediate neighborhood of a dress contain iodoform , a poison which in certain animal produce degenerative change in the kidney and liver which be peculiarly prone to calcification , be striking and worthy of note . 7 . in how far the decalcification of the affected area may have be due to the carbohydrate free regime with the consequent excess in the excessive elimination of calcium , it be impossible , on the basis of a single case , to say . the coincidence in time of the disappearance of calcium from the breast with this treatment  a large abscess of the breast from which bacillus typhosus and staphylococcus aureus be obtain on culture almost entirely heal with complete disappearance of    a deposit of calcium be , however , remarkable and extremely suggestive . 
a specific antivenin against crotalus venom can be prepare bv the immunization of goat . a specific antivenin against water moccasin venom can be produce by goat with water moccasin venom , modify by hydrochloric acid . immunization with the unmodified venom be very difficult . the toxicity of crotalus venom be diminish more than fifty percent . by passage through a Chamberland filter . there be a simple relation between the toxicity of  crotalus venom and the body weight for guinea-pig weigh from 250 to 500 gram . smaller guinea-pig -lrb- 125 gram -rrb- be comparatively less resistant . the toxicity of  crotalus venom be smaller by subcutaneous than by intraperitoneal injection -lrb- smaller guinea-pig -lrb- 125 gram -rrb- -rrb- , or by intravenous injection -lrb- rabbit -rrb- . White rat be very resistant . the toxicity of cobra venom be not measurably diminish by filtration through a Chamberland filter . the relation between the amount of venom and the corresponding time of death be very regular , and can be express by a curve of asymptotic nature . Lecithin do not increase the toxicity of  crotalus venom . the tracing represent toxin-antitoxin neutralization for the three venom -lrb- crotalus , crotalus -rrb- show deviation from the straight line . this deviation be most pronounced for the toxic quota of the three venom -lrb- crotalus , cobra and moccasin -rrb- . the trace represent crotalus venomantivenin neutralization , determine on smaller guinea-pig -lrb- 125 gram -rrb- , can , within error of experiment , be express by the equation : Free toxin . Free antitoxin k . toxin-antitoxin . the corresponding trace determine on rabbit be somewhat different , but both tracing be much more markedly curved than that for cobra venom-antivenin . the neutralization trace of water moccasin venom show the peculiarity , that small amount of antivenin decrease the toxicity of  crotalus venom to a minimum , but the toxicity of  crotalus venom be again increase by further addition of antitoxin . the trace represent neutralization of the haemolysin of the three venom -lrb- crotalus , cobra and moccasin -rrb- be different from the tracing of neutralization of the toxin , and approach very closely to a straight line . still , in all instance , the determination with great concentration of antilysin show pronounce deviation , perhaps due to some dissociation of the toxin-antitoxin combination . 
previous investigator have find that complete occlusion of the ureter may lead either to hydronephrosis or to atrophy . in Lindemann 's series of six dog ; , for instance : two animal show simple hydronephrosis , three animal show simple atrophy , and in one animal the kidney be slightly enlarged and the ureter and pelvis dilate , but fluid be absent . in Lindemann 's series of four rabbit , all show hydronephrosis . the result , whether hydronephrosis or atrophy , be evidently not determine by the time elapse after the operation . Lindemann 's find that the intrapelvic pressure result from the ligation obliterate the luman of the vessel , first of the vein and subsequently of the artery ; but that this be compensate by a increase of the collateral blood supply through the degree of this compensation determine the presence or absence of hydronephrosis , the degree of this compensation determine the presence or absence of hydronephrosis . if the collateral blood supply be free , the fluid after tap will accumulate again and again . it be somewhat remarkable that all of we dog show hydronephrosis after the first operation . the result of establish a urinary fistula differ in the two case in which a urinary fistula be try : the fluid after tap do not re-form in dog 3 even when sodium sulphate be inject : whereas in dog 4 , a very abundant quantity of fluid reaccumulate spontaneously ; but 4 differ notably in composition from the original fluid , have more the character of a purulent inflammatory exudate . the histological change consist in no necrosis , obliteration of the glomerulus , increase of connective tissue , and endarteritis and periarteritis . different area in the same kidney be affect in very different degree , some area appear almost normal . the glomerulus be generally less altered than the tubule . the collect tubule be generally displace so as to run parallel to the surface ; many be dilate . the histological change correspond closely to those describe by Lindemann 's . the sound kidney show slight hyperaemia and hypertrophy , but no necrosis . this correspond with the finding of Pearce and of Ames . the uniformity in chemical composition of the fluid obtain , after the first operation , from the four dog ' , as show by Column III of Table I , be very striking , and point to a uniform origin by a process which be but little affect by the interval elapse after the operation . the specific gravity , total solid and proteid correspond to those describe by Lindemann 's dilute lymph , be but a trifle above those of cerebro-spinal fluid and aqueous humor , and much lower than those of serum , lymph and most cystic fluid -lrb- the proteid content of the latter be generally from 2 to 6.5 per cent . -rrb- . the human fluid -lrb- column ii -rrb- which have remain in the kidney for a very long time have a particularly low proteid percentage ; while that of the second fluid of dog 4 -lrb- Column VIII -rrb- be very much higher ; this last fluid have a pronounced inflammatory character and being of recent formation . the absence of notable amount of the specific urinary constituent be particularly important . -lrb- 4 -rrb- odorous principle be entirely absent . urinary pigment appear to be present in the four dog ' urine , but absent from the human case , -lrb- 5 -rrb- and after the second operation in case of the four dog ' . it seem fair to assume that urinary pigment be secrete shortly after the ligation , when the sound kidney be still functional , and that the four dog ' urine be reabsorb with extreme slowness . urea be present in all the fluid , but a very abundant quantity of fluid be very small in the four dog ' , and probably in the human case . a very abundant quantity of fluid be on the whole somewhat greater than in the serum -lrb- 0.103 per cent. , in place of 0.05 per cent . -rrb- , but the difference may be within the analytical error . the same apply to the ammonia , phosphate and sulphate . a important difference between these fluid on the one hand and blood serum , lymph and ordinary exudate on the other , lie in the higher contents of chlorid , and the consequently greater molecular concentration . the ordinary chlorid content of body fluid vary between 0.55 and 0.70 per cent. , mean about 0.6 per cent -lrb- as nacl -rrb- , while that of the second fluid of dog 4 -lrb- Column VIII -rrb- 
1 . both diphtheria and tetanus toxin and they antitoxin arc electro-positive , that be , they antitoxin pass to the cathode under the influence of a electric current . 2 . the character of the charge be not alter by a change in the reaction of the solvent . 3 . the combination of toxin and antitoxin would seem to represent not a true chemical reaction but the adsorption of one colloid by another . 
1 . in the liver of portal cirrhosis there be a far freer communication between the arterial and portal current than in the normal liver . 2 . factor contribute to the increase portal pressure in portal cirrhosis be -lrb- 1 -rrb- the direct communication of the arterial pressure to the portal vessel through dilated capillary , -lrb- 1 -rrb- the direct communication of the arterial pressure to the portal vessel through dilated capillary to the portal flow in cirrhosis as compare to that in the normal liver . 3 . a portal cirrhotic liver give passage to a amount of portal fluid proportionate to . a portal cirrhotic liver weight . there be no obstruction to the portal vessel from fibrosis in the large portal cirrhotic liver . 4 . from a arterial inflow there be a free return flow through the portal as well as through the hepatic vein in both normal and cirrhotic liver . 5 . from a portal inflow the return be through the hepatic vein only . the Gad 's theory of valve and the arterial capillary network account for this fact . 6 . the increase portal pressure in portal cirrhosis have a decide influence on -lrb- 1 -rrb- the direct communication of the arterial pressure to the portal vessel through dilated capillary and vice versa . a decide influence on   -lrb- 1 -rrb- the direct communication of the arterial pressure to the portal vessel through dilated capillary be more marked in the cirrhotic than in the normal liver . 7 . a important factor in a explanation of       the increase portal pressure in portal cirrhosis be a important factor in a explanation of the increase portal pressure in portal cirrhosis . 
the conclusion I would draw from this work be merely the conclusion I would draw from this work . 1 . the result obtain by injection of streptococcus be different from those produce by micrococcus rheumaticus . 2 . micrococcus rheumaticus can not be regard as a attenuate streptococcus , nor acute rheumatism as a attenuate streptococcus attenuate streptococcal pyaemia . 3 . in uncomplicated case of acute rheumatism the organism may not be find in the blood or in the joint exudate . 
the inhibit action of the blood serum upon the enzyme of the polynuclear leucocyte , leucoprotease , leucoprotease , be exert by the albumin fraction of the blood serum upon the enzyme of the polynuclear leucocyte , leucoprotease . the albumin fraction of  the blood serum upon the enzyme of the polynuclear leucocyte , leucoprotease contain no proteolytic enzyme . the globulin fraction of the blood serum upon the enzyme of the polynuclear leucocyte , leucoprotease contain no anti-enzyme for leucoprotease ; the globulin fraction of  the blood serum upon the enzyme of the polynuclear leucocyte , leucoprotease contain , on the contrary , a enzyme which digest proteid in a neutral or alkaline medium . this enzyme which be present in   the blood serum upon the enzyme of the polynuclear leucocyte , leucoprotease resemble leucoprotease which be present in the polynuclear leucocyte of a inflammatory exudate and in the bone marrow from which these cell be derive , and be doubtless identical with the similar enzyme occur in smaller quantity in the spleen . this enzyme which be present in the blood serum upon the enzyme of the polynuclear leucocyte , leucoprotease be hold in check by this enzyme which be present in   the blood serum upon the enzyme of the polynuclear leucocyte , leucoprotease no anti-enzyme for leucoprotease , but the latter be in such excess that the serum as a whole be capable of check the inhibit action of the blood serum upon the enzyme of the polynuclear leucocyte , leucoprotease when add in considerable quantity . leucoprotease of one mammalian species be inhibit by serum of other mammalian species , but the anti-enzymotic activity of various serum differ ; the anti-enzyme of the rabbit 's serum be stronger than that of dog 's serum , when test either with dog 's or with the rabbit 's leucoprotease . the co-existence in the rabbit of leucoprotease with feeble strength and anti-body of great activity may explain the absence in these animal of typical suppuration with liquefaction of tissue . the serum of bird which have be test , namely , pigeon and hen , almost completely fail to inhibit mammalian leucoprotease -lrb- of dog -rrb- .   the polynuclear leucocyte , leucoprotease , leucoprotease , the bone marrow from which these cell be derive and the spleen of the hen do not contain a enzyme resemble leucoprotease of mammal . the absence of the anti-enzyme of the rabbit 's serum be associate with absence of a corresponding enzyme in   the polynuclear leucocyte , leucoprotease , leucoprotease . 
1 . Tetanolysin and antitetanolysin travel toward the cathode under the influence of a electric current . 2 . the specific agg-lutinin be electro-positive . 3 . the proteid matter of serum be not amphoteric but travel toward the cathode under the influence of a electric current whether the proteid matter of serum reaction be acid , neutral , or alkaline . 4 . the bacteria-agglutinin combination may be disassociate by means of a electric current . 
the experiment show merely that blood vessel transplant from dog to cat can act as artery for seventy-seven day at least ; and that have spend several day in cold storage do not interfere with they ordinary function . the animal operate upon must , however , be keep under observation for several month , or , indeed , for several year , before any conclusion can be draw concern the practicability of this method of preservation and heterotransplantation of blood vessel transplant from dog to cat . 
follow the division before use , the result present in the precede page may be briefly state . I . the particular method of sensitization and the place where the test injection be make have a important bearing on the result obtain by various worker . compare the result obtain by the various method , we may conclude that the incubation period of the hypersensitive reaction be not sharply limited , but that there be a progressive increase in sensitiveness from the sixth day , and presumably before we , extend over a period of several week . it seem very probable that the degree of hypersensitiveness attain where the sensitize dose consist of a mixture of diphtheria toxin and serum be greater than when a single dose of the same small quantity of serum be give alone . II . we early experiment , the first in this field , be in thorough agreement with those first report by Otto , and shortly after Otto by Rosenau and Anderson . III . the hypersensitive reaction be transmissible from mother to offspring . the transmission be probably not equally effective in all case , and individual young guinea-pig probably vary greatly in the rate with which Rosenau and Anderson lose Rosenau and Anderson ability to react . as a result not all of the young of a hypersensitive mother react to a subcutaneous dose of five cubic centimeter of serum give when Rosenau and Anderson be four or five week old . the reaction in the young animal differ quite markedly from that in those actively sensitize . these difference be such as to indicate that in a hypersensitive mother there be a considerable localization of the reaction in tissue and organ whose destruction do not cause sudden death . this local reaction be a protective factor and be not transmit to the same degree as the factor involve in the fatal acute reaction . iv . the hypersensitive reaction to horse serum depend on the development of a special anti-body during the incubation period , which anti-body may be passively transfer to a fresh animal . if the dose of hypersensitive serum be sufficient , and the intoxicating injection be give directly into the circulation , this passive hypersensitiveness may be enough so that a fresh animal will die when test . there be also in the serum of hypersensitive guinea-pig a uneliminated horse serum element or `` rest , '' which be distinct from this antibody , and probably without influence on the course of the fatal acute reaction . v . the anti-body on which the hypersensitive reaction depend may be entirely neutralize by horse serum without cause symptom . the gradual introduction of increase dose over a total period of twenty-four hour suffice for this . a fresh animal be then , properly speak , neither immune nor refractory , but be essentially in the condition of a normal animal which have recently have a large dose of horse serum . this rapid neutralization be make possible by the great binding power which the subcutaneous and other relatively unimportant tissue have for the toxic element of horse serum . the so-called `` phenomenon of Arthus '' be probably the so-called `` phenomenon of Arthus '' that we have here deal with in the guinea-pig . the fact that a local one be more prominently a local one depend on racial difference . I have encounter case in the guinea-pig in which the condition in the rabbit be closely simulated . 
sporulation of B. anthracis , B. subtilis , B. cereus , B. ruminatus , B. mesentericus , B. anthracoide and B. megatherium do not take place in a agar medium contain eosin `` Gelb '' in a concentration exceed 0.5 per cent . in a concentration of 0.1 per cent . most of these bacterium fail to produce spore . the greatest sensitiveness be show by B. cereus and B. mesentericus . in a bouillon medium sporulation be likewise inhibit by eosin , but after a longer time-seven week or more-sporulation still occur where a concentration of 0.1 per cent dye equal one-tenth per cent . sporulation of B. tetanus , anthraci symptomaticus , B. botulismus , B. oedema malignus , enteritidi sporogene , and B. putrificus do not take place in a medium contain eosin `` Gelb '' in concentration exceed 0.03 per cent . with these organism , no difference be note in the final effect , depend on the medium employ . no permanent loss of power to produce spore ensue with the bacterium test even after long sojourn in the eosinize media . it may be state that on the whole the inhibitory action of eosin be more pronounced upon the anaerobic than upon the aerobic species of bacterium employ in these experiment . 
calcium salt hasten and magnesium salt retard the development of rigor mortis , that be , when calcium salt be administer subcutaneously or intravenously . when inject intra-arterially , concentrate solution of both kind of calcium salt cause nearly a immediate onset of a strong stiffness of the muscle which be apparently a contraction , bring on by a stimulation cause by calcium salt and due to osmosis . a contraction , if strong , pass over without a relaxation into a real rigor . this form of rigor may be class as work-rigor -lrb- arbeitsstarre -rrb- . in animal , at least in frog , with intact cord , the early contraction and the follow rigor be stronger than in animal with destroy cord . if m/8 solutions-nearly equimolecular to `` physiological '' solution of sodium chloride-are use , even when inject intra-arterially , calcium salt hasten and magnesium salt retard the onset of rigor . the hastening and retardation in this case as well as in the case of subcutaneous and intravenous injection , be ion effect and essentially due to the cation , calcium and magnesium . in the rigor hasten by calcium the effect of the extensor muscle mostly prevail ; in the rigor follow magnesium injection , on the other hand , either the flexor muscle prevail or the muscle become stiff in the original position of the animal at death . there seem to be no difference in the degree of stiffness in the final rigor , only the onset and development of the final rigor be hasten in the case of the one salt and retard in the other . calcium hasten also the development of heat rigor . no positive fact be obtain with regard to the effect of magnesium upon heat vigor . calcium also hasten and magnesium retard the onset of rigor in the left ventricle of the heart . no definite datum be gather with regard to the effect of calcium salt upon the right ventricle . 
among so many etiological factor , it be impossible to discriminate which be responsible for the complication which take place in we experiment . a attempt to explain the occurrence of nephritis , cedema or calcification of the arterial system , for instance , will not be make , but the technique of the operation will be modify in order to suppress as much as possible the cause which may originate these secondary change . the purpose of this article be not to analyze minutely the physiological or pathological character of the function of transplant kidney , but merely to ascertain whether the function of transplant kidney be efficiently reëstablished . the purpose of this article be to be conclude that a animal which have undergo a double nephrectomy and the grafting of both kidney from another animal can secrete almost normal urine with a double nephrectomy new organ , and live in good health at least for a few week . this demonstrate that this be possible to reëstablish efficiently the function of transplant kidney of transplant kidney . 
the conclusion to be DEDUCED FROM THIS BRIEF SERIES of EXPERIMENTS be as follow : 1 . the ophthalmo-tuberculin reaction be of some value for diagnosis of tuberculosis in Cattle . a characteristic conjunctivitis with fibrinous exudation come on from six to eight hour , reach a maximum in from sixteen to twenty-four hour and disappear in forty-eight hour , be note in tubercular animal . 2 . the reaction which must necessarily be study be more pronounced in those animal which show themselves clinically to be in the advanced stage of tuberculosis . with this reaction as with the usual tuberculin test one injection and reaction probably inhibit absolutely a second reaction during a period from six week to a year . the ordinary tuberculin test do not seem to interfere to any great extent with the ophthalmo-tuberculin test at least within four week . class b , though recently test , show the reaction which must necessarily be study , although not to the extent of Class A , which be test some time ago . the ordinary tuberculin test occasionally prevent absolutely a second reaction , and usually the second absolutely a second reaction occur within a year , as before state . 3 . in cattle recently test with tuberculin by the subcutaneous method the ophthalmo-tuberculin reaction be only slightly reduce in the subcutaneous method intensity . the ophthalmic test may possibly serve as a means of Cattle which have be test with tuberculin by the ordinary method and will not react a second time , or where tuberculin have be inject into cattle in order that they may clear a second test . another possibility must not be overlook in this connection . it be well know that animal which have a slight tubercular infection often show a very marked and typical reaction to the ordinary tuberculin test as a slight tubercular infection be usually make , and those animal which show they clinically to be in the advanced stage of tuberculosis often show only a very slight reaction . the animal in class b be in the advanced stage of tuberculosis and this fact might perhaps account for the lower intensity of the reaction which must necessarily be study . the exact cause of the lower reaction in Cattle can only be determine by further experimentation . 4 . no constitutional disturbance be notice in any of the cattle test , that be , no rise in temperature , loss of appetite or fall off in the production of milk , it be evident that the instillation of tuberculin into the eye do not produce the general reaction which attend in some case the subcutaneous injection of tuberculin , and be therefore decidedly advantageous . the exudate disappear and leave the eye perfectly normal in forty-eight hour after injection . 5 . if the ophthalmo-tuberculin test at least prove as efficacious as the foregoing experiment seem to indicate we have in the ophthalmo-tuberculin test at least a comparatively rapid and easy means of diagnose tuberculosis in Cattle . such be the case the ordinary method can not fail to come into general use supersede the present laborious method of apply the ophthalmo-tuberculin test at least . Cattle can be inject and then inspect sixteen to twenty-four hour afterward . there be many problem in connection with the reaction which must necessarily be study . a few of the proposition : 1 be a few of the proposition : 1 . be 1 possible to tell by the reaction which must necessarily be study how far the tubercular process have progress in the body ? 2 . be there any relationship between the lower intensity of  the reaction which must necessarily be study and the number and severity of the tubercular lesion ? 3 . will the ophthalmo-tuberculin test at least prove to be more accurate than the ordinary tuberculin test which be say to reveal all but four per cent . of some case ? 4 . will the ophthalmo-tuberculin test at least reveal tuberculosis after a subcutaneous tuberculin injection ? 5 . will animal which have a slight tubercular infection react a second time if the first tuberculin be place in the eye and the second give by the ordinary subcutaneous method and conversely ? these and many more point must be thoroughly investigate before the efficiency of the ophthalmo-tuberculin test at least be prove . the opththalmo-tuberculin test will be repeat on other cattle , and also on the cattle use in the foregoing experiment . EXPERIMENTS be be make to determine the efficiency of the cutaneous tuberculin reaction in Cattle . we wish in this paper to give only the p

Gross variation in Gross output of such cell must affect very considerably the blood picture . 2 . the quantity of lymphocyte supply through the thoracic duct of the healthy dog remain practically constant from hour to hour , if the physiological condition be not notably change . transient change in the physiological condition may alter such cell , but with the disappearance of this change Gross output of such cell tend to resume the disappearance of this change previous rate . these fact indicate that the tissue produce lymphocyte , which be quickly yield to  the blood under certain physiological condition be `` set '' at a rate of activity definite in the individual . 3 . muscular activity -lrb- struggle -rrb- produce a prompt increase in the output of lymphocyte , which be quickly yield to  the blood under certain physiological condition through the thoracic duct . -lrb- a -rrb- this be assure by the presence of a increase number of cell per cubic millimeter of lymph , combine with a increase in the amount of lymph void . -lrb- b -rrb- the lymphocyte-output may be triple or quadruple during a long-continued struggle . -lrb- c -rrb- follow prolonged struggle the output of lymphocyte , which be quickly yield to  the blood under certain physiological condition be for a short time less than previous to the exertion . 4 . the increase lymph-flow cause by a lymphagogue of the second class -lrb- glucose -rrb- bring with the increase lymph-flow cause by a lymphagogue of the second class -lrb- glucose -rrb- increase the output of lymphocyte , which be quickly yield to  the blood under certain physiological condition through the thoracic duct . -lrb- a -rrb- the individual cubic millimeter of lymph be often poor in such cell , during the rapid lymph-flow , yet the total number of element transport be large . -lrb- b -rrb- the result with glucose support the theory of Ehrlich , that a rapidly appear lymphocytosis may be produce through the flushing effect of the increase lymph-flow cause by a lymphagogue of the second class -lrb- glucose -rrb- . 5 . a comparison of the effect of struggle with those of glucose demonstrate that in the former some factor besides increase in the increase lymph-flow cause by a lymphagogue of the second class -lrb- glucose -rrb- -lrb- Ehrlich -rrb- work to cause the large output of lymphocyte , which be quickly yield to  the blood under certain physiological condition . the nature of some factor besides increase in   the increase lymph-flow cause by a lymphagogue of the second class -lrb- glucose -rrb- -lrb- Ehrlich -rrb- have not yet be determine . 6 . the variation cause by muscular exertion and by increase lymph-flow in the number of lymphocyte course through the thoracic duct be so pronounced as to suggest that the total number of lymphocyte in circulation must be considerably influence by those of glucose . the clinical finding indicate that this be true ; and the clinical finding other observer become much simpler of interpretation . 7 . the result in general prove the existence , reserve from circulation , of a large fund of lymphocyte , which be quickly yield to  the blood under certain physiological condition , which be quickly yield to the blood under certain physiological condition . 
positive result have be obtain in but a single set of those in which turpentine be employ , namely those in which turpentine be employ . in so far as the result of this preliminary study go , one be lead to the conclusion that thrombosis be most readily induce when active inflammatory lesion exist in the blood vessel , associate , probably in most instance , with secondary degenerative change . purely mechanical lesion be much less apt to be productive of condition favorable to thrombosis as a sequence of phlebitis . marked artificial increase or decrease in the coagulation time of the blood by the use of calcium lactate or citric acid , do not render animal abnormally prone to thrombosis incite by change other than inflammatory . when true phlebitis exist , thrombosis be apt to be more extensive and less readily resolve , when the coagulation point of the blood have be shorten by the use of calcium lactate , and the coagulation point of  the blood be less extensive and more quickly absorb when the coagulation time of the blood have be increase by the administration of citric acid . experiment as yet incomplete appear to suggest that the increase in rapidity or slowing of the general circulatory stream have but little bearing on the production of thrombosis in phlebitis , much less , indeed , than clinical and anatomical observation have generally lead we to think . we have also be lead to suspect that the presence or absence of anastomosis of abundant degree be largely concern as a factor in determine the location and extent of thrombosis in phlebitis . 
in this view and the positive result obtain in the above experiment , this view would seem probable that the production of waxy degeneration depend upon the action of lactic acid which be form by the living muscle under the stimulation of infect bacterium or they toxin , the formation of large amount of lactic acid and the living muscle accumulation be perhaps favor by defective circulation through the injured muscle . the hyaline transformation of muscle act upon by lactic acid be analogous to the swell of fibrin place in dilute acid . this view be support by both negative and positive experimental evidence-the negative evidence be that simple anemic necrosis , aseptic or antiseptic autolysis whether in vivo or in vitro , or the action of bacterium of various sort on muscle in vitro , be all incapable of cause change in muscle cell resemble those characteristic of waxy or hyaline degeneration of striated muscle . both negative and positive experimental evidence-the negative evidence consist in the demonstration that lactic acid , even in dilution comparable to the amount that can be form in live muscle , can produce a similar or identical waxy transformation of the striated muscle fiber , both in vitro and in vivo ; and also the observation that muscle stimulate to exhaustion , under which condition lactic acid be know to accumulate in the living muscle , show microscopically change identical with those of Zenker 's waxy degeneration . 
1 . tetany occur spontaneously in many form and may also be produce by the destruction of the parathyroid gland . recent research tend to demonstrate a intimate relation between the various form of tetany and relative or absolute insufficiency of the parathyroid gland . 2 . the parathyroid gland be the parathyroid gland . whether or not this function be intimately related to that of other organ of internal secretion be not as yet prove . 3 . the number and distribution of the parathyroid gland vary . failure to produce tetany experimentally be probably due to the fact that some parathyroid tissue remain after a apparently complete extirpation . when extirpation be complete tetany appear , even in herbivora . only a very small amount of parathyroid tissue be require to prevent this . 4 . the effect of the extirpation of the parathyroid gland may be annul by the reintroduction of a extract of the parathyroid gland from a animal of widely different character . the active principle be associate with a nucleo-proteid in a extract of   the parathyroid gland and may be separate with this nucleo-proteid from the remain inert albuminous substance . the active principle effect in Tetany appear some hour after injection and last several day . 5 . the parathyroid gland contain no considerable amount of iodine . the parathyroid extract be not the parathyroid extract . 6 . in tetany there be apparently some disturbance of the composition of the circulate fluid ordinarily prevent by the secretion of the parathyroid , which disarrange the balance of the mineral constituent of the tissue especially . possibly this consist in the appearance of a injurious substance of a acid nature for such tetany may he relieve by extensive bleeding with replacement of the blood by salt solution . no actual poisonous material have , however , be demonstrate by the transference of the blood of a tetanic animal to the vein of a normal one . 7 . numerous research have show the important relation of the calcium salt to the excitability of the central nervous system . they withdrawal leave the nerve cell in a state of hyperexcitability which can be make to disappear by supply they with a solution of a calcium salt . 8 . Tetany may be regard as a expression of hyperexcitability of the nerve cell in a state of hyperexcitability which can be make to disappear by supply they with a solution of a calcium salt from some such cause . 9 . the injection of a solution of a salt of calcium into the circulation of a animal in tetany promptly check all the symptom and restore a animal to a apparently normal condition . 10 . injection of magnesium salt probably have a similar effect but these effect be mask by the toxic action of a salt of calcium . 11 . the injection of sodium or potassium salt have no such beneficial effect but rather tend to intensify the symptom . this be true also of the alkaline salt of sodium which be study especially in respect to this basic property . 12 . the effect of calcium be of value in human therapeutics in combate the symptom of spontaneous form of tetany and in relieve the symptom in case of operative tetany and thus tide over the period of acute parathyroid insufficiency until remnant of parathyroid tissue can recover this or not this function or new parathyroid tissue can be transplant . the effect of calcium be in this way a important and convenient ally of the method of inject parathyroid extract . 13 . study of the metabolism in parathyroidectomized animal show : 1 . a marked reduction in the calcium content of the tissue especially of the blood and brain , during tetany . 2 . a increase output of calcium in the urine and faeces on the development of tetany . 3 . a increase output of nitrogen in the urine . 4 . a increase output of ammonia in the urine with 4a . a increase ammonia ratio in the urine . 5 . a increase amount of ammonia in the blood . much of this afford evidence of the existence of some type of acid intoxication . much of this these effect be , however , not neutralize by the introduction of the alkaline salt of sodium which be study especially in respect to they basic property and may perhaps be regard as especially important in produce a drainage of the calcium salt from the tissue especially whi 
a gram-negative streptococcus be associate with one form of fatal septicemia arise naturally in Macacus rhesus confine in laboratory . a gram-negative streptococcus differ from streptococcus pyogene in a gram-negative streptococcus behavior to gram 's method of staining ; in a gram-negative streptococcus slight fermentative power ; in the persistence of vitality for a very long time in a gram-negative streptococcus culture ; in a gram-negative streptococcus high degree of pathogenicity for certain lower animal ; and in the preservation of a gram-negative streptococcus virulence undiminished for many month when cultivate upon artificial media . in the present state of we knowledge a gram-negative streptococcus must be consider as not identical with any streptococcus heretofore describe . 
1 . the autotransplantation of parathyroid glandule into the thyroid gland and behind the musculus rectus abdomini have be successful in sixty-one per cent . of the case in which a deficiency greater than one-half have be create . 2 . in no instance have the autotransplantation of parathyroid glandule into the thyroid gland and behind the musculus rectus abdomini succeed without the creation of such deficiency . 3 . Isotransplantation have be uniformly unsuccessful . 4 . parathyroid tissue transplant in excess of what be urgently require by the organism have not live . 5 . one parathyroid autograft may suffice to maintain the animal in good health and spirit for many month and possibly for year . 6 . excise or deprive of they blood supply in the course of operation upon the human subject , parathyroid gland should , in the present state of we knowledge , be graft , and probably into the thyroid gland . 7 . complete excision of the thyroid lobe in dog may be well bear for a year or more . the myxoedema which usually have manifest 7 within a few week have not increase after the first few month . may the myxoedema which usually have manifest 7 within a few week subsequently diminish with the hypertrophy of accessory thyroid ? 8 . parathyroid tissue be essential to the life of dog , as have be conclusively prove by the result of excision of the sole , sustain graft . there may be find , perhaps , in we experiment , explanation of the fact observe by other -lrb- Enderlen , Payr -rrb- that , when transplant , thyroid preserve Enderlen integrity less well than parathyroid tissue . in the instance record the amount of thyroid gland excise may have be insufficient to make possible the fullest success of the transplantation ; and particularly so when we consider the extent of the hypertrophy of which the thyroid gland seem capable . 
1 . the inhibit action of urine on catalase depend to a great extent on the inhibit action of urine on catalase reaction . the urine of a nephritic have no greater inhibit power than normal urine provide the reaction of urine test be neutral . 2 . the catalytic activity of a single rabbit 's blood be constant from day to day . 3 . there be considerable variation in the catalytic action of the blood of different rabbit . 4 . follow ligation of the ureter the blood of different rabbit gradually decrease ; the tissue of a animal which have die as a result of the ureter show a decide decrease in catalytic activity , when compare with those of normal animal . 5 . follow bilateral nephrectomy the same decline of the blood of different rabbit be observe as after bilateral ligation of the ureter . 6 . follow unilateral nephrectomy the blood of different rabbit may temporarily fall and then rise above the catalytic activity of a single rabbit 's blood previous level , or the catalytic activity of a single rabbit 's blood may fall continuously . Wherever the continuous fall occur a animal which have die as a result of    the ureter die . 7 . when the kidney be allow to function but the urine of a nephritic be drain into the peritoneal cavity there be no change in the catalytic activity of the tissue post-mortem but a marked rise in the blood of different rabbit accompany the result peritonitis . 8 . the same rise in the blood of different rabbit be obtain in experimental bacterial peritonitis . this might be of diagnostic importance in determine early inflammation of the peritoneum . 9 . a kidney function normally change substance circulate in the blood of different rabbit into urinary product devoid of any influence on catalase . if a kidney function normally change substance circulate in  the blood of different rabbit into urinary product devoid of any influence on catalase . can not effect no change in the catalytic activity of the tissue post-mortem , change substance circulate in  the blood of different rabbit remain unaltered in the circulate blood and by this presence inhibit the catalytic activity of the blood of different rabbit and organ . 10 . nephritis -lrb- uranium nitrate -rrb- . - a . in acute nephritis there be a marked decrease in the blood of different rabbit and of the tissue post-mortem . a marked decrease in      the blood of different rabbit and of   the tissue post-mortem may vary directly with the amount of urine excrete . B. with the onset of uraemia the blood of different rabbit decrease markedly and follow in a general way the urinary finding , especially a general way the urinary finding . if a animal which have die as a result of    the ureter recover the catalase gradually rise . C. although the catalytic activity of a normal rabbit 's blood be constant from day to day , the catalytic activity of a normal rabbit 's blood . the catalytic activity of the blood may under certain condition indicate the functional sufficiency of the kidney much more accurately than the urinary finding . 
the bacillus of Bordet and Gengou be present in the sputum in early case of pertussis , and in the lung at autopsy in fatal case of the disease . after the second week it be not present in the sputum in sufficiently large number to be readily isolate . the influenza the bacillus of Bordet and Gengou be find at as early a stage of pertussis as be the Bordet-Gengou the bacillus of Bordet and Gengou the bacillus of Bordet and Gengou , and the influenza the bacillus of Bordet and Gengou persist in the sputum for a longer time . the agglutinin in the blood of the patient ' be not more regular and not always higher for the Bordet-Gengou the bacillus of Bordet and Gengou than for B. influenza . the two organism be culturally distinct and the agglutinin in the blood of pertussis patient action on laboratory animal different . complement deviation test with the serum of immunized rabbit show a further difference in the immune body produce by the two variety of bacillus . the negative result of the complement deviation test with the patient ' serum in this study , compare with the positive result of similar test make by Bordet and Gengou , I be not able to account for . this study have contribute support to the view that the Bordet-Gengou the bacillus of Bordet and Gengou be the Bordet-Gengou the bacillus of Bordet and Gengou , but this study have not produce any distinctively new evidence of this relationship beyond the proof of the wide dissemination of the peculiar bacillus in nature and this study occurrence in pertussis . a study of bronchial secretion in other acute disease of the respiratory tract for the bacillus of Bordet and Gengou have not yet be extensively make and be call for . I shall hope to report on this phase of the subject at another time . 
1 . under certain condition , general autolysis do not begin immediately upon the removal of the organ from 1 circulation . this latent period be more apt to be present in those case in which the tissue have be temporarily cool on account of the use of a cold saline diluent or in which the percentage concentration of the inorganic salt -lrb- calcium or potassium -rrb- , of the tissue have be change by dilution with a sodium chloride solution . the presence of blood and absence of fat and of glycogen in the cell act as important factor in prolong this latent period . 2 . attempt to produce a alkaline reaction -lrb- phenolphthalein -rrb- in the tissue result negatively . Solutions of disodium hydrogen phosphate and of sodium bicarbonate when add to the liver tissue give a mixture which be acid to phenolphthalein and have no apparent effect upon autolysis . 3 . the addition of antiseptics-chloroform and toluol-markedly decrease the rate of autolysis . ordinary light produce no apparent effect upon autolysis . 4 . Ethyl butyrate when add to the tissue become hydrolyse into butyric acid ; the formation of this acid in a mixture which be acid to phenolphthalein cause a decide acceleration in the autolytic rate . the acidity of a solution of dihydrogen sodium phosphate fail to produce a similar result . 5 . the figure for the change in the depression of the freezing-point , non-coaguable nitrogen and reaction of the autolytic mixture do not parallel one another . in some experiment a marked increase in the freezing-point be unaccompanied by augmentation of non-coagulable nitrogen . 6 . the sum total of proteolytic , amylolytic and lipolytic factor be the sum total of proteolytic , amylolytic and lipolytic factor . each of these autolytic factor may proceed alone for a time ; the rate of one be decidedly influence by the presence or absence of the other . the acid product which be the result of amylolytic -lrb- lactic acid -rrb- and of lipolytic -lrb- higher fatty acid -rrb- autolysis , exert a pronounced augmentative effect upon the commencement and rate of nitrogenous autolysis . 
1 . the high value in respect to complement-binding exhibit by the blood serum from syphilitic and spinal fluid from general paralytic be associate with a excessively high content of globulin , but there do not exist a direct quantitative relation between the two . case of secondary syphilis which have be under prolonged and proper medication do not exhibit the globulin increase and usually fail to give the Wassermann reaction . the active substance enter into the Wassermann reaction be precipitable with the globulin and chiefly with the euglobulin fraction of spinal fluid . 2 . temperature of 70 degree to 76 degree c. destroy the active substance enter into   the Wassermann reaction . expose to sunlight the active substance enter into   the Wassermann reaction deteriorate slowly . a photodynamic substance such as eosin , under the direct influence of the sun , bring about they complete and rapid destruction . this effect do not occur in the dark . the active substance enter into   the Wassermann reaction be subject to tryptic and peptic digestion and be destroy by weak acid and alkali . 3 . the active substance in the blood serum and spinal fluid can not be separate from they or from the globulin precipitate by alcohol . 4 . there be contain in the alcoholic extract of normal and syphilitic blood and organ certain acetone-soluble lipoid which possess high antigenic value for the Wassermann reaction . Cholesterin be inactive and the bile salt less active than the lipoidal body . 5 . sodium cholate be about as active as sodium taurocholate and glycocholate , but neurin and cholin be inactive . 
the foregoing and earlier datum take together demonstrate that a active immunity last several year can be produce in guinea-pig , by the injection of toxin-antitoxin mixture which have no recognizable harmful effect either immediate or remote . they also show , what might have be anticipate , that under the same condition mixture which produce local lesion and which , therefore , contain a excess of toxin produce a much higher degree of immunity than the neutral mixture , and that a excess of antitoxin reduce the possibility of produce a active immunity , and may extinguish a excess of antitoxin altogether . there be , therefore , a certain definite relation between the component of the mixture and a much higher degree of immunity producible . furthermore , toxin-antitoxin mixture do not change materially within five day at room temperature . they be apparently more efficacious at the end of forty-eight hour than immediately after preparation . the experiment finally prove that a relatively high degree of active immunity can be induce by a harmless procedure , whereas the use of toxin alone lead to very severe local lesion be incapable of produce more than a insignificant protection . the method , therefore , invite further test in regard to the method ultimate applicability to the human being . unless the subcuti of the guinea-pig react to toxin-antitoxin mixture in a manner peculiar to the subcuti of the guinea-pig , a practical , easily controlled method for active immunization can be work out which should afford a larger protection than the serum alone and avoid the complication associate with horse serum . that proportion of the toxin and antitoxin which would produce the highest desirable immunity consistent with the least discomfort would have to be carefully work out for the human subject . from the nature of the immunity induce it be obvious , however , that such a method of immunization can not take the place of a large dose of antitoxin in expose individual who must be protect at once . the nature of the immunity induce would be applicable only as a general protective measure without reference to any immediate danger , since the nature of the immunity induce would take several week , perhaps longer , to perfect the attainable immunity . pass to the theoretical aspect of the fact observe , we find no publication bear directly upon we . Madsen have , however , approach the human subject very closely in Madsen have , however the experiment on the immunization of animal with mixture not fully balanced , or , in other word , in which the `` toxone '' be still free . Madsen have , however find that the injection of such mixture in rabbit , goat and horse produce a active immunity . Madsen have , however make the significant remark that perhaps in the immunize capacity the `` toxone '' may possess the keenest reagent for a poison which be not able to exert any toxic action in the body . this be fully bear out by the experiment describe , for in these the `` toxone '' pass beyond the visible spectrum , so to speak , of the toxin-antitoxin effect , and the `` toxone '' be able to recognize toxic action only by the lasting immunizing effect . another publication which touch upon some phase of the same problem be that of Morgenroth on the union between the toxin and antitoxin . Morgenroth bring out the fact that a give toxin-antitoxin mixture be more toxic when inject directly into the circulation than when inject under the skin . thus , a l -lrb- + -rrb- dose of 0.78 c.c. toxin + one unit antitoxin apply subcutaneously be of the same toxicity as 0.68 c.c. toxin + one unit antitoxin inject into the circulation . when the mixture have stand twenty-four hour this -lrb- l -lrb- + -rrb- -rrb- dose be still 0.78 c.c. subcutaneously , but the mixture have rise to 0.74 c.c. when introduce by the intracardiac route . the author make two deduction from these result . the author assume that the velocity of reaction between the toxin and antitoxin be slow , and that the union between   the toxin and antitoxin be not complete until the mixture have stand twenty-four hour this -lrb- l -lrb- + -rrb- -rrb- . hence , the l -lrb- + -rrb- dose of toxin inject into the blood be higher after twenty-four hour this -lrb- l -lrb- + -rrb- -rrb- than immediately after mix the toxin and antitoxin . the author furthermore explain the fact that the subcutaneous l -lrb- + -rrb- dose remain the sam 
with the return of the circulation , dilation of the pericellular lymph space and slight swell of the cell body occur , disappear as recovery progress . Chromatolysis , as evidence by poor affinity for clump , diffuse staining , ,    clump , diffuse staining , , clump , diffuse staining , , and break into dust-like particle , induce by anaemia , be not necessarily fatal . death of the cell be not show histologically when tissue be remove and fix immediately after the experiment . some time must elapse for the detection of the vacuolation , displacement of the nucleus and solution of the chromatic substance , indicative of profound change . neurone from different region as well as neurone of the same region differ in degree of resistance to anaemia . the small pyramidal cell be the small pyramidal cell , and then come the sympathetic ganglion cell , the sympathetic ganglion cell . failure to resuscitate animal after anaemia of the central nervous system be probably due to the destruction of many of the cell of the vital center -lrb- vaso-motor and respiratory -rrb- which do not have histological peculiarity by which vaso-motor and respiratory may be define . death of the cell , of a few cell of any center do not necessarily mean the total loss of the function of the center , since the remain cell may be sufficient to discharge the function of  the function of the center . 
1 . anatomical lesion of the pancreas , namely occur in more than seven-eighths of all case of diabetes mellitus . 2 . in diabetes associate with the pancreas , namely , the island of langerhan constantly show no pathological change . 3 . in some case of pancreatic diabetes -lrb- twelve of ninety case -rrb- the lesion of the pancreas , namely be limit to the island of langerhan . 4 . in sixteen case of diabetes associate with hyaline degeneration of the island of langerhan the average duration of the disease have be three and a half year ; in forty-six case with sclerosis of these body , three year and eleven month . in of all case of diabetes the average duration of the disease have be eleven month . 5 . destructive lesion of the island of langerhan may be associate with compensatory hypertrophy of other interacinar island . 6 . peculiar adenoma-like hypertrophy of the island of langerhan occur in a small proportion of these case and may be associate with adenoma of the thyroid gland -lrb- two case -rrb- and of the pituitary body -lrb- one case -rrb- . 7 . Diabetes mellitus occur in association with haemochromatosis -lrb- bronzed diabetes -rrb- be referable to pigmentation and destruction of the island of langerhan . 8 . the pancreas , namely be find to exhibit no pathological change in twelve per cent . of these case . in approximately one-half of these case approximately one-half of these case have be note that the size of the thyroid gland -lrb- two case -rrb- or the number of island be much less than normal . 9 . fifty per cent . of these case of diabetes mellitus occur before the age of thirty year be associate with the pancreas , namely ; seventy-five per cent . of all case of diabetes in which the pancreas , namely be normal occur before the age of thirty year . ninety-seven per cent . of these case of diabetes occur after the age of thirty year be associate with the pancreas , namely ; and eighty-six per cent . occur in association with chronic interacinar pancreatitis accompany arteriosclerosis . 10 . interacinar pancreatitis which occur in seventy-three per cent . of all case of diabetes be almost constantly associate with arteriosclerosis : gangrene of the extremity , which occur with one-fourth of all case of interacinar pancreatitis , be doubtless referable to the same cause . 11 . chronic interlobular pancreatitis , when associate with diabetes , be accompany by sclerosis or hyaline degeneration of the island of langerhan . 12 . Diabetes in association with myxoedema or with exophthalmic goiter may be referable to a lesion of the pancreas , namely , namely , chronic interacinar inflammation with sclerosis of the island of langerhan ; diabetes in association with acromegaly may be referable to a lesion of the island of langerhan , namely , sclerosis and hyaline degeneration with adenoma-like hypertrophy . 
1 . the secretion of urine and the elimination of fluid through the intestinal canal which be cause by the intravenous injection of solution of 0.85 per cent . sodium chloride be decrease by the addition of calcium chloride to the sodium chloride solution . the secretion of urine and the elimination of fluid through the intestinal canal which be cause by the intravenous injection of solution of 0.85 per cent . be more markedly inhibit than be the elimination of fluid through the intestine . 2 . in contradistinction to the decrease elimination of fluid through the kidney and intestine , addition of calcium chloride to the sodium chloride solution increase markedly the transudation of fluid into the peritoneal cavity . to a certain degree urine and the elimination and the ascite may be say to increase in a inverse proportion . 3 . although calcium chloride inhibit both absorption from and secretion into the intestine it seem to decrease the secretion of urine and the elimination of fluid through the intestinal canal which be cause by the intravenous injection of solution of 0.85 per cent . more markedly than both absorption . 4 . a double one : first be a double one : first , by diminish the amount of urine secrete : secondly , by increase the ascite independently of the amount of urine secrete : secondly action on the kidney and intestine . a direct action on the endothelial cell of   the peritoneal cavity may be a direct action on the endothelial cell of the peritoneal cavity : this , however , must be determine by further investigation . 5 . addition of calcium chloride to the infuse fluid increase the tendency to the occurrence of edema of the lung . 6 . infusion of large quantity of fluid into animal dilute the blood , but this dilution seem to be carry only to a certain degree - about 30 per cent.-and to be independent of the chemical character of the sodium chloride solution and of the function of the kidney and intestine . 7 . the presence or absence of the kidney and intestine have a marked influence on the intestinal and ascitic fluid . when the average of ascitic and intestinal fluid per 1,000 c.c. of retain fluid in non-nephrectomized animal and these fluid per 1,000 c.c. of infuse fluid in the nephrectomized animal be compare , more fluid be find in the case of the nephrectomized animal . this fact can only be explain in part by the shorter time necessary for the same amount of fluid to be retain in the nephrectomized animal . Nephrectomy cause a increase of the ascite and ascitic and intestinal fluid per 1,000 c.c. of retain fluid in non-nephrectomized animal and these fluid per 1,000 c.c. of infuse fluid in nephrectomized animal through a mechanism which will have to be investigate by means of further experiment . 
in NORMAL ANIMALS -lrb- dog , cat and rabbit -rrb- which be kill by EXSANGUINATION , the begin of rigor in PRACTICALLY all case be separate from respiratory death by two well characterize period : -lrb- 1 -rrb- a period of pulsation during which each ventricle still exhibit some spontaneous contraction , and -lrb- 2 -rrb- a period of relaxation during which the ventricle , while show neither some spontaneous contraction nor rigor , be more relax than in normal diastole , and during which the ventricle gradually lose cat irritability . -lrb- the cardiac rigor or tonic contraction which be observe by recent investigator to set in immediately after death be a artificial phenomenon produce by fill the heart with saline and connect the heart with a manometer . -rrb- in the right ventricle both period : -lrb- 1 -rrb- a period of pulsation during which each ventricle still exhibit some spontaneous contraction be longer than in  i. e. i. e. , rigor set in later . moreover the development of rigor from the onset be also longer in the right ventricle than in the left , although here the difference be less striking . the stop of spontaneous beating , the disappearance of irritability , and the development of rigor from   the onset , manifest in both ventricle a topographical progress from the base toward the apex ,  i. e. , the stoppage of beating , the disappearance of irritability , and    the development of rigor from   the onset , manifest in both ventricle a topographical progress from the base toward the apex and the setting in of rigor occur first at the uppermost part of  i. e. and last at the lowest point of  i. e. . the stop of spontaneous beating , the disappearance of irritability , and    the development of rigor from   the onset , manifest in both ventricle a topographical progress from the base toward the apex ,   i. e. , the stoppage of beating , the disappearance of irritability and the setting in of rigor often occur that rigor be already present in the basal part of a ventricle while the apex be still beat . the stop of spontaneous beating , the disappearance of irritability , and    the development of rigor from   the onset , manifest in both ventricle a topographical progress from the base toward the apex ,   i. e. , the stoppage of beating , the disappearance of irritability and the setting in of rigor be probable also that the loss of vital activity and irritability and the development of rigor progress topographically from the endocardial to the epicardial surface . prolonged etherization retard the onset , but hasten the development of rigor from   the onset ; atropinization hasten both onset and development . repeated prolonged stoppage of the heart cause by antemortem -lrb- and postmortem -rrb- the stimulation of   the pneumogastric nerve hasten the onset as well as the development of rigor of the heart . all three period be affect by the inhibitory influence of the stimulation , -lrb- 2 -rrb- a period of relaxation during which the ventricle , while show neither spontaneous contraction nor rigor , be more relax than in normal diastole , however , seem to be the one which be shorten most . the most probable interpretation of a artificial phenomenon produce by fill the heart with saline and connect it with a manometer be the most probable interpretation of  a artificial phenomenon produce by fill the heart with saline and connect it with a manometer that the most probable interpretation of  a artificial phenomenon produce by fill the heart with saline and connect it with a manometer be cause by a asphyxiation of the cardiac tissue . the stimulation of the pneumogastric nerve seem to hasten also the onset of the general rigor-probably the result of some premature asphyxiation of the skeletal muscle , too , be the result of some premature asphyxiation of the skeletal muscle . 
1 . the hook the worm the Old and New World types-contain a weak hemolytic agent active in vitro . the hook worm of man-both the Old and New World types-contain a weak hemolytic agent active in vitro . be soluble in salt solution , be easily destroy by heat and act slowly . 2 . the hemolysin be present in all part of the worm and probably be associate with the intestinal tract . 3 . the hook worm of the dog contain a similar hemolysin . 4 . these hemolysin be not specific , but will act on human blood as well as on that of the dog and rat . these hemolysin be only demonstrable in concentrated extract . 5 . concentrate extract of the human whip worm may be hemolytic to some blood . 6 . the round worm of man contain no hemolytic principle in any part of the round worm of man body . 7 . it seem very unlikely that this weak hemolysin find in the hook worm of the dog can have any relation to the anemia of uncinariasis . 8 . study of the `` blood cyst '' in the human intestine show that the hook worm of the dog may live in a small amount of the host 's blood for day without cause any marked hemolysis . 
the follow inference MAY be MADE FROM the FOREGOING study : 1 . the lesion result from fat starvation , at least in the case of pig , do not resemble or even suggest those of rickets . 2 . prolonged fat starvation lead to the entire disappearance of fat from the adipose tissue . the form of fat atrophy observe as the result of experimental fat starvation correspond to the serous fat atrophy describe by Flemming , and be essentially the same type of fat atrophy as the serous fat atrophy describe by Flemming find in the epicardial and perirenal fat in the human subject as the result of waste disease . 3 . the . lecithin of the brain and the fat of the liver be not materially reduce by fat starvation . 4 . Fat starvation do not lead to advanced serous fat atrophy of the subcutaneous fat if the animal be give a large excess of carbohydrate food or a considerable excess of the carbohydrate and proteid constituent of milk . 5 . Fat starvation cause a very imperfect absorption of the salt of p -lrb- 2 -rrb- o -lrb- 5 -rrb- from the intestine . 
to summarize , WE HAVE BEEN ABLE to DEMONSTRATE : -lrb- 1 -rrb- in a case of acute trichinosis a extensive leucocytosis , with great absolute and relative increase in the number of eosinophilic cell in the blood , associate with a coincident decrease in the quantity of neutrophilic element . -lrb- 2 -rrb- from the examination of specimen of the muscle , besides the peculiar degeneration of the muscle , a longitudinal splitting of some of the fibre ; a remarkable transverse splitting of other ; a great proliferation of nucleus , about many of which vacuole be see ; and large number of polymorphonuclear eosinophilic cell , large number of polymorphonuclear eosinophilic cell be especially prevalent in the more degenerate area . -lrb- 3 -rrb- in a second case -lrb- after death -rrb- , besides similar change in the muscle , large number of eosinophile throughout the infested portion . -lrb- 4 -rrb- in two other case , during life , a great increase of the eosinophilic cell in the blood , with a coincident decrease of the polymorphonuclear neutrophile , associate with leucocytosis , though of less extent than in the first case . -lrb- 5 -rrb- in piece of muscle remove in these last two case change in most respects similar to those cite in the first case , but of less degree . -lrb- 6 -rrb- the similar character of the nucleus of the eosinophile and the polymorphonuclear neutrophile both in the blood and in the muscle , and the presence in the first case of certain cell which might be regard as form transitional between neutrophile and eosinophile , suggest the possibility that the increase in the latter element may , in these instance , take place in the muscle by direct transition from the polymorphonuclear neutrophile . 
-lrb- 1 -rrb- the typhoid bacillus be demonstrate in the urine of 9 out of 38 typhoid patient -lrb- about 25 per cent -rrb- . 172 specimen be examine with 44 positive result . -lrb- 2 -rrb- the typhoid bacillus , when demonstrate , be always present in large number and in practically pure culture . -lrb- 3 -rrb- the typhoid bacillus appear first in the later stage of the disease and persist in the great majority of case far into convalescence . 38 typhoid patient should , therefore , not only be rigidly disinfect during the disease , but the urine of 9 out of 38 typhoid patient should also be carefully supervise during convalescence . -lrb- 4 -rrb- the typhoid bacillus be practically always associate with albuminurium and the presence of renal cast . on the other hand urine contain considerable amount of albumin and cast in large number often show no typhoid bacillus . -lrb- 5 -rrb- irrigation of the bladder with antiseptic solution offer a possible means for remove permanently the bacillus from the urine . 
the conclusion seem warrant that the giant cell form in the absorption of coagulate blood serum insert into the anterior chamber of the rabbit 's eye subdivide again into uninuclear small cell that take part with other new-formed cell derive from the lining of this space to form a densely fibrillate mass of tissue that resemble quite closely the cornea in blood serum insert into the anterior chamber of the rabbit 's eye subdivide again into uninuclear small cell that take part with other new-formed cell derive from the lining of this space structure . this demonstration materially strengthen the opinion express by the writer in the rabbit 's eye subdivide previous article in this Journal , * that the giant cell in healing non-degenerated tuberculous tissue may separate into small living cell , and that the giant cell of tuberculosis be not the giant cell of tuberculosis , especially in Germany . 
the typhoid bacillus produce a mild diffusible toxine , partly within the intestinal tract , partly within the blood and organ of the body . a mild diffusible toxine produce proliferation of endothelial cell which acquire for a certain length of time malignant property . the new-formed cell be epithelioid in character , have eccentrically situate nucleus , lightly stain , eccentrically situate nucleus , eccentrically situate nucleus eccentrically situate nucleus , and be characterize by marked phagocytic property . these phagocytic cell be produce most abundantly along the line of absorption from the intestinal tract , both in the lymphatic apparatus and in the blood-vessel . they be also produce by distribution of a mild diffusible toxine through the general circulation , in greatest number where the general circulation be slowest . finally , they be produce all over the body in the lymphatic space and vessel by absorption of the toxine eliminate from the blood-vessel . the swell of the intestinal lymphoid tissue of the mesenteric lymph node , and of the spleen be due almost entirely to the formation of these phagocytic cell . the necrosis of the intestinal lymphoid tissue of the mesenteric lymph node be accidental in nature and be cause through occlusion of the vein and capillary by fibrinous thrombus , which owe the swell of the intestinal lymphoid tissue of the mesenteric lymph node , and of the spleen origin to degeneration of these phagocytic cell beneath the lining endothelium of the vessel . two variety of focal lesion occur in the liver : one consist of the formation of the phagocytic cell under the action of the toxine absorb by the lymphatic ; the other be due to obstruction of the liver capillary by phagocytic cell derive in small part from the lining endothelium of the liver capillary , but chiefly by embolism through the portal circulation of cell originate from the endothelium of the blood-vessel of the intestine and spleen . the liver cell lie between the occluded capillary undergo necrosis and disappear . later the focus of the liver cell lie between the occluded capillary degenerate and fibrin form between the swell of the intestinal lymphoid tissue of the mesenteric lymph node , and of the spleen . Invasion with polymorphonuclear leucocyte be rare . many of the phagocytic cell pass through the liver and lung , and get into the general circulation . a few come from the abdominal lymphatic through the thoracic duct . 
-lrb- a -rrb- . the bacillus isolate by I from the outbreak of choleraic diarrhoea correspond closely in all essential particulars with that of european chicken cholera . -lrb- b -rrb- . the bacillus isolate by I from the outbreak of choleraic diarrhoea differ , consequently , from that isolate from previous outbreak of choleraic diarrhoea in the United States . -lrb- c -rrb- . a study of the acid production by this and ally bacillus would seem to show that the amount of acid produce by so variable a microbe vary greatly and be incapable of afford a further means of distinguish between ally form . 
acute interstitial nephritis be find in the infectious disease of child , particularly in diphtheria and scarlet fever , but may be meet with in other infectious disease . the disease be characterize by general and focal infiltration of the interstitial tissue of the kidney with cell which correspond to those which Unna have describe under the name of plasma cell . the focal character of the infiltration be mark ; even in the case in which all part of the kidney show some interstitial cellular infiltration the cell which have emigrate be most abundant in certain focus . certain focus be find in three place : in the boundary zone of the pyramid , in the sub-capsular region of the cortex , and around the glomerulus . a considerable number of case be find in which the blood-vessel of the pyramid contain nnmber of lymphoid and plasma cell without any infiltration of the interstitial tissue of the kidney . the new cell in the interstitial tissue of the kidney be due to emigration from the blood-vessel of      the pyramid and multiplication by mitotic division of the cell which have emigrate . the cell which have emigrate can emigrate as plasma . cell which correspond to those which Unna have describe under the name of plasma cell or lymphoid and plasma cell , and the latter may change into plasma cell in the tissue . in the normal individual , plasma cell may be form in the mucous membrane of the intestine , where they practically form the entire tissue between the epithelium and the musculari mucosa , and to a limited extent in the spleen . in diphtheria , in scarlet fever , and probably in a number of infectious disease , plasma cell be form in great number in the spleen and bone-marrow , and to some extent in the lymphatic gland . in the spleen they be form from the cell of the malpighian body , which be often principally compose of they , and to some extent from the cell in the pulp . they be form from cell which correspond to those which Unna have describe under the name of plasma cell or   lymphoid and plasma cell , and the latter . no adequate explanation be find for the focal character of the lesion in the kidney . there be some ground for believe that the physical condition of the circulation may have something to do with they accumulation in the vessel in certain place . it be also possible that in the interstitial focus there may be soluble substance which exert a positive chemotaxi for they . such substance may be foundin the urine , which may exert the urine influence on the interstitial tissue in different place . the explanation of the interstitial focus can not be find in primary focal degeneration of the epithelium . epithclial degeneration in the case in which all part of  the kidney show some interstitial cellular infiltration be always present , but the explanation of  the interstitial focus be diffuse . in focus where the explanation of  the interstitial focus be more intense and due to the interstitial change , polynuclear leucocyte be find in the interstitial tissue in different place , in the degenerate epithellum and in the tubule . folynuclear lencocyte and not plasma cell be attract by degenerate tissue . the interstitial focus be not due in the case in which all part of  the kidney show some interstitial cellular infiltration to the local action of the bacterium . in a number of the case in which interstitial nephritis be find the kidney be show to be sterile both by culture and by microscopical examination . in case where the bacterium be present folynuclear lencocyte be find only in small number in culture and not on microscopical examination , and folynuclear lencocyte connection with the interstitial focus could not be demonstrate . in three case plasma cell be find in the interstitial tissue in definite bacterial disease of the kidney . in the case in which all part of  the kidney show some interstitial cellular infiltration folynuclear lencocyte be not find in connection with the lesion produce directly by the bacterium , but in the periphery of the purulent focus . 
until recently diphtheria '' toxin '' be suppose to be a single definite substance and to have a definite toxicity in animal and neutralize power for antitoxin . a fatal dose of toxin , without regard to the condition under which diphtheria '' toxin '' be produce or preserve , be suppose to require always the same quantity of antitoxin to neutralize a fatal dose of toxin , without regard to the condition under which diphtheria '' toxin '' be produce or preserve . Ehrlich 's research have completely do away with this theory , and have substitute for this theory one which assume the toxin to be only at this theory origin a single definite chemical compound with definite physiological and antitoxic property . accord to Ehrlich 's a unstable substance which readily lose  a definite toxicity in animal and neutralize power for antitoxin , while at the same time its affinity for antitoxin may be either increase or decrease be a unstable substance which readily lose a unstable substance which readily lose  a definite toxicity in animal and neutralize power for antitoxin , while at the same time its affinity for antitoxin may be either increase or decrease a definite toxicity in animal and neutralize power for antitoxin , while at the same time the same time affinity for antitoxin may be either increase or decrease . a unstable substance which readily lose a unstable substance which readily lose  a definite toxicity in animal and neutralize power for antitoxin , while at the same time its affinity for antitoxin may be either increase or decrease a definite toxicity in animal and neutralize power for antitoxin , while at the same time its affinity for antitoxin may be either increase or decrease neutralization by antitoxin Ehrlich 's consider to be due to a chemical union between a unstable substance which readily lose a unstable substance which readily lose  a definite toxicity in animal and neutralize power for antitoxin , while at the same time its affinity for antitoxin may be either increase or decrease a definite toxicity in animal and neutralize power for antitoxin , while at the same time its affinity for antitoxin may be either increase or decrease and the antitoxin . the result of we experiment as detail in this paper be fully in accord with those publish by Ehrlich 's , as to the vary neutralize value of a minimal fatal dose of '' toxin '' ; the vary neutralize value of a minimal fatal dose of '' toxin '' , however , go further and indicate roughly a general law in accordance with which these change occur . the neutralize value of the fatal dose of a toxin be at the neutralize value of     the fatal dose of a toxin lowest in the culture fluid when the first considerable amount of toxin have be produce . after a short period , during which the quantity of toxin in the culture fluid be increase , the fatal dose , the other of new toxin formation , which probably tend to diminish the neutralize value begin to increase , at first rapidly , then more slowly . while the culture be still in vigorous growth and new toxin be be produce , the fatal dose , the other of new toxin formation , which probably tend to diminish the neutralize value fluctuate somewhat , but with a generally upward tendency . after the cessation of toxin production the fatal dose , the other of new toxin formation , which probably tend to diminish the neutralize value increase steadily until the cessation of toxin production become five to ten time the cessation of toxin production original amount . in we experiment the greatest value for l -lrb- only 72 -rrb- be 126 , the least 27 . as at 6 hour l -lrb- only 72 -rrb- be   only 72 , we doubt whether l -lrb-    -rrb- ever reach above 150 , and therefore hardly expect Ehrlich 's figure of 200 to be realize . when we seek to analyze the above-described process , we find certain fact which seem partly to explain the above-described process . we experiment the greatest value for l -lrb- only 72 -rrb- be 126 , the least 27 have show that filter toxin , preserve for any length of the same time in condition under which access of air occur , gradually lose in both toxin , preserve for any length of the same time in condition under which access of air occur toxicity and neutralize power , and that toxin , preserve for any length of the same time in condition under which access of air occur lose more rapidly in the former property than in the later . thus , while the fatal dose of a toxin preserve for one year rise from .01 cc . to .55 cc. , .55 cc. lose only half as much in neutralize     the fatal dose , the other of new toxin formation , which probably tend to diminish the neutralize value , the other of new toxin formation , which probably tend to diminish the neutralize value , at the end of the year 25 cc . these process take place more rapidly at room temperature than in the ice chest , and in the incubator than in the room . in the culture fluid hold the living bacillus we have , therefore , after the first few hour of toxin formation , the first few hour of toxin formation , one of deterioration in the toxin already accumulate , which tend to increase the neutralize value of the fatal dose , the other of new toxin formation , which probably tend to diminish the neutralize value ,   the fatal dose , the other of new toxin formation , which probably tend to diminish the neutralize value , the other of new toxin formation , which probably tend to diminish the neutralize value . the chemical change produce by the growth of the bacillus in the bouillon tend to aid one or the other of these process and so to make from hour to hour slight change in   the fatal dose , the other of new toxin formation , which probably tend to diminish the neutralize value ,                 the fatal dose , the other of new toxin formation , which probably tend to diminish the neutralize value , the other of new toxin formation , which probably tend to diminish the neutralize value . later , with the period of toxin production , the gradual deterioration of both toxin , preserve for any length of the same time in condition under which access of air occur toxicity alone continue , and   the fatal dose , the other of new toxin formation , which probably tend to diminish the neutralize value ,                 the fatal dose , the other of new toxin formation , which probably tend to diminish the neutralize value , the other of new toxin formation , which probably tend to diminish the neutralize value gradually and steadily increase in the period of    toxin production     the fatal dose , the other of new toxin formation , which probably tend to diminish the neutralize value , the other of new toxin formation , which probably tend to diminish the neutralize value . Ehrlich 's theory , as to the splitting up of '' toxin '' into toxoid have little or both toxin , preserve for any length of the same time in condition under which access of air occur toxicity but on the average full neutralize power for antitoxin , have not in we opinion be substantiate by we experiment the greatest value for l -lrb- only 72 -rrb- be 126 , the least 27 . the difference between the amount of toxin mix with a unit of antitoxin which cause the first symptom and that cause death upon the fourth day would be , the fourth day be true , explain by this theory , but the failure of this difference to be greater where , by  Ehrlich 's theory , epitoxoid should be in great abundance prevent we acceptance of Ehrlich 's view . the 
i. culture of b. coli communis , b. coli communis . pyogenes aureus , when inject into the tissue of the normal spleen , soon disappear from that organ , and indeed from the normal body generally . II . bacterium inject into a spleen after the whole or a part of the vessel have be tie , multiply in the spleen with great rapidity and continue to supply bacterium to the blood , whence in the healthy body b. coli communis soon disappear ,  the blood , whence in the healthy body b. coli communis soon disappear , whence in the healthy body b. coli communis soon disappear . III . bacterium inject into the spleen , liver , kidney , uterus , testicle , peritoneum , or subcutaneous tissue , or into the blood current through the ear vein , in case in which moderate lesion have be make by cauterization or compression in the spleen , liver , kidney , uterus , testicle , peritoneum , or subcutaneous tissue , usually find lodgment in moderate lesion and multiply there . iv . even in case in which numerous focus exist , from which  the blood , whence in the healthy body b. coli communis soon disappear ,         the blood , whence in the healthy body b. coli communis soon disappear , whence in the healthy body b. coli communis soon disappear be constantly provide with a fresh supply of bacterium , only few bacterium be find at any time in  the blood , whence in the healthy body b. coli communis soon disappear ,         the blood , whence in the healthy body b. coli communis soon disappear , whence in the healthy body b. coli communis soon disappear . 
1 . dextrose be not in 1 to toxin production . when add in quantity not exceed 0.2 per cent to peptone bouillon free from fermentable acid-producing substance -lrb- the muscle sugar -rrb- 0.2 per cent lead to a maximum accumulation of toxin by utilize the available peptone to the best advantage . 2 . the different course take by culture of the diphtheria bacillus in ordinary unfermented peptone bouillon contain the muscle sugar and in peptone bouillon make from fermented infusion to which 0.1 to 0.2 per cent dextrose have be add be manifest by a increase production of toxin in the latter as well as by a rapid return from a acid to a alkaline reaction . in the former a acid reaction may prevail even under most favorable condition . 3 . these difference may be explain by assume either that the acid product of the muscle sugar be different from those of dextrose and non-utilizable , or else that peptone bouillon make from fermented infusion to which 0.1 to 0.2 per cent dextrose have be add contain certain other unknown inhibitory substance remove during fermentation . the use of synthesize media and a analysis of the acid product of the muscle sugar in fermented bouillon plus dextrose and in unfermented bouillon would aid in explain these difference . 4 . among the accessory condition which favor the toxin production in unfermented bouillon , as point out by Park and Williams , be increase quantity of peptone , well develop surface growth of the diphtheria bacillus , and a low initial acid reaction -lrb- phenolphthalein -rrb- . in fermented bouillon the accessory condition which favor the toxin production in unfermented bouillon , as point out by Park and Williams , be increase quantity of peptone be also favor , though of leg importance . 
588.780 grm . of frog , all of the same sex , of the same comparative approximate weight , take from the ground about nearly the same time , keep awake and without food for nearly the same time , be divide into equal group ; the one group be poison with phosphorus , the other group hold as a control . the poison frog lose in dry residue 8.821 grm . or 16.5 per cent of the dry residue of the control group ; 1.182 grm . of nitrogen , correspond to 7.388 of proteid , or 18.45 per cent of the nitrogen and protein in the control frog ; the 1.026 grm . of fat , or 22.64 per cent of the fat in the control animal ; and 0.261 grm . glycogen , or 13.3 + per cent of the glycogen in the control frog . I believe that it be obvious that in these experiment no fat be produce from protein . mathematically , it be possible to conceive that no fat could have be form but entirely burn up . as previously state , the carbon in the proteid lose during the poisoning be equivalent to   the carbon in the proteid lose during the poisoning . of fat , and the carbon in the proteid lose during the poisoning be the carbon in the proteid lose during the poisoning . of fat be form , but that they , together with the 1.026 grm . of fat actually lose during these experiment , be burn . in brief , the fat combustion might have be tremendously increase , and mask a actual fat formation . this however be unsupported by evidence , and be highly improbable . it be hard to conceive that in a organism whose katabolic function be greatly augmented as the result of phosphorus poisoning , in which protein , fat , and glycogen be be burn in excess , the carbon of protein , fat , and glycogen would first have be convert into fat , or 22.64 per cent of the fat in the control animal ; and then the fat burn as such . I believe the only conclusion which can be draw from these experiment be that fat , or 22.64 per cent of the fat in the control animal ; be form as the result of phosphorus poisoning , in which protein , fat , and glycogen be be burn in excess . thus the fatty degeneration so-called which occur in the control frog do not comprehend any formation of fat at all , but simply the deposition of fat . these result be directly opposite to those of Polimanti 's . Polimanti 's apparently do not weigh Polimanti 's the control animal before the beginning of the experiment , and base Polimanti 's calculation upon the relation of fat , or 22.64 per cent of the fat in the control animal ; to the dry residue of the control group . obviously Polimanti 's calculation be base upon the assumption that the dry residue of a frog be unaffected by phosphorus poisoning . Polimanti 's , in decline to base Polimanti 's calculation upon the weight of the control animal when dead , state that as water be often increase , such a calculation would be misleading . but since the dry residue of the control group may and do vary , calculation base upon the dry residue of the control group be also misleading , and thus the only proper basis of calculation be the only proper basis of calculation . calculate upon the basis of the dry residue of the control group , in I material the percentage of the control animal be 8.48 per cent , in the poison animal 7.86 per cent , so that , even upon the basis of Polimanti 's incorrect calculation , in I experiment fat be lose in notable quantity . just before this study be complete , the publication of Athanasiu , -lrb- 8 -rrb- from Pflueger 's laboratory , appear . operate with a large number of frog , and under vary condition , with careful method and rigid control , Athanasiu reach the conclusion : that phosphorus poisoning have no effect upon the total quantity of fat in frog ; that phosphorus poisoning have little effect upon the nitrogen and protein in the control frog ; that phosphorus poisoning produce a diminution in the quantity of glycogen ; and that thus the fatty degeneration so-called which occur in  the control frog be really thus the fatty degeneration so-called which occur in  the control frog . while these result agree with those of Athanasiu in the essential point , that fat , or 22.64 per cent of the fat in the control animal ; be produce by phosphorus poisoning , those of Athanasiu in the essential point differ in that the poison frog , in these experiment , lose fat , or 22.64 per cent of the fat in the control animal ; and protein as well as glycogen , while Athanasiu in the essential point the poison frog lose glycogen , or 13.3 + per cent of the glycogen in   the control frog . . since almost the same be almost the same , the difference must have reside either in the condition surround these experiment , or in the control animal . I do not believe that such difference exist between the Rana fusca and esculenta of Europe and the Rana palustri of America as to explain the difference in these result . these difference I believe may be explain by vary condition . I 
OUR conclusion from the literature and our own experiment MAY be summarize as follow : i. blood for bacteriological examination during life should be take directly from the vein and in considerable quantity . II . the most important feature in case of sepsis be the most important feature in case of sepsis ; pyogenie bacterium invade the general circulation in a rather small proportion even of severe ease , and , as a rule , late in the course of the disease . III . a general infection by the pnenmococcus can be demonstrate occasionally in the late stage of acute lobar pneumonia . iv . the value of blood culture as a means of diagnosis in obscure case of sepsis be limit by the fact that invasion of the blood by the specific organism can not be demonstrate during life in case where the autopsy be perform promptly after death . positive culture be very valuable ; negative culture do not exclude local septic infection . v . the detection of specific bacterium in the blood of case of sepsis and of pneumonia give a very unfavorable prognosis in most case . VI . general terminal infection with pyogenic coccus occasionally occur as a immediate cause of death in chronic disease . local infection process play this part more frequently . vii . as far as our own experiment MAY be summarize as follow : i. blood for bacteriological examination during life have show , a rather uncommon occurrence , be a rather uncommon occurrence . viii . owe to the relative infrequency of agonal invasion , believe that in the majority of case where the autopsy be perform promptly after death , the bacterium which be find in     a rather uncommon occurrence succeed in reach     a rather uncommon occurrence previously to the death agony , and be associate with the course of the disease . ix . the presence of bacterium in the organ of late autopsy be due in many case to post-mortem extension from one organ to another , and in some case to the post-mortem growth of small number of genus which be distribute to     a rather uncommon occurrence by means of the general circulation in a rather small proportion even of severe . 
it would , of course , be incorrect to attempt to draw conclusion as to the danger and the chance of success of suture of cardiac wound in man from the result obtain by animal experimentation . the animal be place in very unfavorable condition after the operation . they be very restless and can not be keep quiet . Ideal cleanliness be impossible and the animal may infect they wound by rub the external wound against the dirt on the floor of they cage . from the animal mortality in these investigation no rigid inference applicable to human being can therefore be make . some conclusion of importance can , however , be draw . above all , my experiment seem to show that the mammalian heart will bear a much greater amount of manipulation than have hitherto be suspect . very large wound of the mammalian heart can heal and the healing process occur in a manner entirely analogous to that in other muscular tissue . even a extensive suture of the heart-wall of rabbit and dog , although we know that thereby a large number of muscle fibre be destroy and replace by connective tissue , do not interfere with the function of the cardiac muscle as a whole . can some of the result in the above recorded experiment be , with some restriction of course , apply to the human heart ? my think that this question must be answer in the affirmative . if we compare the knowledge we possess of very large wound of  the mammalian heart in man , with that obtain from animal experiment , and find that that obtain from animal experiment agree in all essential particulars , then we be justified in reasoning by analogy that             wound of the heart in man , when all other means have be try and find want will give the result in the above recorded experiment similar to those obtain in the animal . in the last few decade , the advance make in all the branch of medicine-especially in pathology , bacteriology and surgery-have be due to a great extent to the generalization of animal experimentation . to the careful and critical investigator , the result obtain in the animal experiment have always be of the greatest value in indicate to surgery-have be due to a great extent to the generalization of     animal experimentation the possibility of result to be obtain by similar procedure in the human body . from the study of wound of the heart in man , when all other means have be try and find want , this conclusion seem therefore justified : wound of             wound of the heart in man , when all other means have be try and find want , when all other means have be try and find want , can and ought to be close by suture . the application the study of               wound of the heart in man , when all other means have be try and find want of a interrupted one be devoid of the one great danger that be fear in the past , the past during the manipulation incident upon the application of the suture . the number of suture should be as small as possible so as to limit the amount of connective tissue which will be form ; for all the muscle fibre that be compress by the suture eventually atrophy and be replace by new-formed connective tissue . it be probable that this connective tissue will not lead to degenerative change in the heart-muscle . on the post-mortem table , fibrous plaque be often find in the otherwise normal human heart . in a number of the muscle of the human body fibrous bands-tendinous intersection as they be called-are normally find . in the large number of microscopic section of the heart-muscle that my have examine , my could find no evidence of pathological change in the muscle fibre some distance from the scar . for similar reason a interrupted one should always be a interrupted one . we have show that there be danger and disadvantage in the continuous suture both on theoretical grounds and in practical use . the suture should be pass through as little of the heart substance as possible ; if they penetrate the epicardium and a small part of the thickness of the heart-muscle the epicardium will generally be sufficient . when the mammalian heart action be not too rapid , each suture should be tie during a diastolic relaxation of a small part of the thickness of  the heart-muscle under treatment . on this point we have not yet any experience in man . Cappelen , in Cappelen patient , tie the suture during systole . Rehn tie they in Rehn case during diastole . only time and further experience will show how much importance be to 
from a case of acute endocarditis of the aortic and mitral valve with infarction m the spleen and kidney a micrococcus be twice isolate in pure culture from the blood during life and be demonstrate after death both microscopically and in pure culture in large number in the valvular vegetation , the infarction and other part . no other species of microorganism be find . a micrococcus be very small , occur mainly in pair , sometimes in short chain , short chain , grow in small , pale , grayish-white colony on gelatine and agar , at first cloud bouillon , which then become clear with a whitish sediment , do not produce gas in glucose media , liquefy gelatine slowly and to some extent also blood serum , and be especially characterize by a whitish sediment behavior in milk , which a whitish sediment acidify , coagulate and subsequently liquefy . a micrococcus produce a milk-curdling ferment and also a proteolytic ferment , each of which be separable from the bacterial cell . a micrococcus remain viable for month in old culture and be tolerably resistant to the action of heat and antiseptic . a micrococcus be pathogenic for mouse and rabbit , cause either abscess or general infection . typical acute vegetative endocarditis be experimentally produce by intravenous inoculation of the organism in a rabbit and a dog , and the coccus be demonstrate in pure culture in the valvular vegetation and other part of these animal after death . although a micrococcus here describe have some point of resemblance to the pneumococcus and streptococcus pyogene on the one hand and to the pyogenic staphylococcus on the other , it be readily distinguish from each of no other species of microorganism by cultural feature which have be describe and which be so obvious that the differentiation of these species from a micrococcus need not be discuss in detail . have search through the record concern microorganism describe in association with endocarditis and other disease , as well as the record concern microorganism describe in association with endocarditis and other disease , and have be unable to find a description of a micrococcus identical in all particulars with that here describe . such point as staining by gram , liquefaction of gelatine , coagulation and peptonization of milk , serve singly or in combination to distinguish a micrococcus from other form which in some respects might resemble a micrococcus . feel justified , therefore , in recognize the organism in a rabbit and a dog as a new species and from the organism in a rabbit and a dog fermentative property propose for the organism in a rabbit and a dog the name `` micrococcus zymogene . '' micrococcus zymogene must be add to the already considerable list of bacterium which have be find as the specific infective agent in endocarditis . that the already considerable list of bacterium which have be find as the specific infective agent in endocarditis be the already considerable list of bacterium which have be find as the specific infective agent in endocarditis be conclusively demonstrate by the already considerable list of bacterium which have be find as the specific infective agent in endocarditis repeat isolation in pure culture from the blood during life , by the already considerable list of bacterium which have be find as the specific infective agent in endocarditis presence in pure culture and large number after death in the cardiac vegetation , the infarction , and other part of the body , and by the experimental proof of the already considerable list of bacterium which have be find as the specific infective agent in endocarditis pathogenic property , and notably the already considerable list of bacterium which have be find as the specific infective agent in endocarditis capacity to produce vegetative endocarditis by intravenous inoculation in these animal . 
the principal conclusion that SEEM to ME JUSTIFIED be as follow : 1 . the fluorescent pigment form by some variety of B. pyocyaneus be produce under condition identical with those govern the production of the fluorescent pigment form by some variety of B. pyocyaneus by other `` fluorescent bacterium . '' 2 . the production of pyocyanin be not dependent upon the presence of either phosphate or sulfate in the culture medium . the production of pyocyanin be form in non-proteid as well as in proteid media , but be not a necessary accompaniment of the metabolic activity of the organism -lrb- e. g. tartrate solution -rrb- . 3 . the power of produce pyocyanin under condition of artificial cultivation be lose sooner than the fluorescigenic power . 4 . there be greater natural and acquire difference in pyocyanigenic power than in fluorescigenic . 5 . the fluorescent pigment form by some variety of B. pyocyaneus may be oxidize slowly by the action of light and air as well as by reagent into a yellow pigment , and pyocyanin may be similarly oxidize into a black pigment . 6 . the following : var would be the following : var . alpha , pyocyanigenic and fluorescigenic -lrb- most common -rrb- ; var . beta , pyocyanigenic only -lrb- rare -rrb- ; var . gamma , fluorescigenic only -lrb- not uncommon , closely related to `` B. fluorescen liquefacien '' -rrb- ; var . delta , non-chromogenic . 7 . except for the occasional loss of one or another function the different variety be not so plastic as sometimes assume , and can not be readily convert into one another by subjection to vary condition of life . 8 . the signification and correlation of the almost countless physiological variation among the member of this group in respect to growth in gelatin , behavior to temperature , indol production , etc. , remain to be determine . it be not yet clear that the variation in chromogenic power can be in any way correlate with the presence or absence of other physiological function . 
1 . bacillus x -lrb- Sternberg -rrb- belong to the colon group . 2 . bacillus icteroide -lrb- sanarellus -rrb- be a member of the hog-cholera group . 3 . the various channel of infection , the duration of the disease and the gross and microscopical lesion in mouse , guinea-pig and rabbit be bacillus icteroide when feed to the domestic pig this bacillus . 4 . the clinical symptom and the lesion observe in dog inoculate intravenously with bacillus icteroide when feed to the domestic pig , be reproduce in these animal by infection with this bacillus . 5 . bacillus icteroide when feed to the domestic pig cause fatal infection , accompany by diphtheritic , necrotic and ulcerative lesion in the digestive tract , such as be see in hog when infect with this bacillus . 6 . the disease may be acquire by expose swine in pen already infect with bacillus icteroide when feed to the domestic pig , or by feed bacillus icteroide when feed to the domestic pig with the viscera of infected pig . 7 . guinea-pig may be immunize with sterilize culture ofbacillus icteroide from a fatal dose of   the various channel of infection , the duration of the disease and the gross and microscopical lesion in mouse , guinea-pig and rabbit this bacillus and vice versa . 8 . rabbit may be render immune by gradually increase dose of a living culture of bacillus icteroide of weak virulence from a fatal dose of a virulent culture of   the various channel of infection , the duration of the disease and the gross and microscopical lesion in mouse , guinea-pig and rabbit this bacillus 9 . the serum of animal immunize with bacillus icteroide when feed to the domestic pig and with   the various channel of infection , the duration of the disease and the gross and microscopical lesion in mouse , guinea-pig and rabbit this bacillus , respectively , show a marked reciprocal agglutinative reaction . 10 . while the blood of yellow fever practically do not exercise a agglutinative reaction upon bacillus icteroide when feed to the domestic pig bacillus icteroide when feed to the domestic pig this bacillus in a much more marked degree , thus point , we think , to the closer etiological relationship of this bacillus to hog-cholera than to yellow fever . 
-lrb- 1 -rrb- congenital syphilitic pancreatitis retard the development of the glandular acinus but do not affect the island of langerhan . embed in the stroma , but not invade by the stroma , the latter maintain they continuity with the small duct and acinus with which they have a common origin . -lrb- 2 -rrb- two type of chronic interstitial inflammation affect the develop pancreas be distinguishable : -lrb- a -rrb- interlobular pancreatitis.-in the interlobular variety the inflammatory process be localized chiefly at the periphery of the lobule and implicate the island of langerhan of langerhan only when the sclerotic process have reach a very advanced grade . when pancreatitis have follow obstruction of the small duct and acinus with which they have a common origin , the island of langerhan long remain unaltered though embedded in dense scar-like tissue . -lrb- b -rrb- interacinar pancreatitis.-in the interacinar type the inflammatory process be diffuse , invade the lobule and separate individual acinus . the inflammatory change invade the island of langerhan . -lrb- 3 -rrb- a relationship have be observe between lesion of the island of langerhan and the occurrence of diabetes mellitus . -lrb- a -rrb- in one of eleven case of interlobular panereatitis diabetes of mild intensity occur . the sclerosis , which in this case follow obstruction of  the small duct and acinus with which they have a common origin by calculus , be far advance and affect the island of langerhan . -lrb- b -rrb- in two of three case of interacinar pancreatitis , diabetes be present . the third case be associate with a condition , haemochromatosis , which at a later stage be associate with diabetes , the result of pancreatic lesion . -lrb- c -rrb- in a fourth case of diabetes , hyaline deposit between the capillary and the parenchymatous cell have so completely alter the island of langerhan that they be no longer recognizable . 
1 . the ending of the motor nerve in striped muscle remain on the outside of the sarcolemma . aside from the surface of contact of muscle and nerve fibre , the end fibre be cover down to the surface of contact of muscle and nerve fibre tip with the sheath of Schwann and be provide with nucleus . the precise condition of thing at the place of contact of muscle and nerve fibre be the precise condition of thing at the place of     contact of muscle and nerve fibre . 2 . the ivy-like or festoon arrangement of the motor nerve in striped muscle in the frog 's muscle have be misinterpret . properly interpret the frog 's demonstrate that the nerve fibre that be to influence muscle and nerve fibre be not naked and that they need not be the end fibre . the frog 's show that mere contact between muscle and nerve fibre muscle and nerve fibre be all that be necessary . 3 . Henle 's sheath be open , thus permit escape of the cerebrospinal fluid . 4 . in other animal             Henle 's sheath sheath extend over the end fibre of the motor nerve and the cell line the motor nerve envelop the end fibril . I find that the so-called `` Sohlensubstanz '' of Kühne be derive from the cell of             Henle 's sheath Henle 's sheath . 5 . the terminal nerve in smooth muscle form a network entwine the bundle of the smaller muscle fibre of the snake . I consider a network entwine the bundle of  the smaller muscle fibre of the snake improbable that each plain muscle fibre have a special terminal nerve fibril . 6 . in muscular tissue fine non-medullated nerve , probably belong to the centrifugal , vasomotor system , proceed from the fasciculus of the motor nerve in striped muscle . non-medullated nerve can be trace directly to a network of nerve surround the capillary , with which they be very closely unite . from this network fine , nucleated , the end fibre of the motor nerve and the cell pass to the wall of the capillary , with which they be very closely unite , with which the fasciculus of  the motor nerve in striped muscle be very closely unite . 7 . the nerve supply  the capillary , with which they be very closely unite , with which they be very closely unite connect also with sensory nerve and with nerve surround the larger blood-vessel , both artery and vein . 8 . the branch of the chorda tympanus in the submaxillary gland do not pass to the gland cell , but the chorda tympanus in the submaxillary gland terminate on  the capillary , with which they be very closely unite , with which they be very closely unite . 9 . in muscular and glandular tissues-and perhaps throughout the body-there be a vast peripheral nervous plexus belong to the capillary blood-vessel . these nerve of  the capillary , with which they be very closely unite , with which they be very closely unite , which may perhaps be regard as nutritive nerve , regulate the production and transudation of lymph , and be concern in the mechanism of glandular secretion . they may be call into activity both by peripheral influence and by impulse receive from the central nervous system and the sympathetic ganglion . they may influence , through they connection with the vasomotor nerve on the artery and vein , the blood supply to a part . 
1 . bile increase the digestion of fat when give by the mouth in pill form . the percentage of fat lose in the stool of we patient with a complete biliary fistula be 63 per cent in the first period and 57 per cent in the third . this closely correspond to the result that Müller obtain in human being and dog with complete obstruction of the common duct . under bile medication the stool of we patient contain 23 per cent less fat than in the first period , and 17 per cent less than in the third . this represent a actual diminution of the amount of fat lose in the stool of we patient . look at the result in another way , the result in another way may be say that 40 per cent be 40 per cent ; in the period with bile , 60 per cent , i. e. , bile increase the digestion of fat relatively by 50 per cent . 2 . the digestion of nitrogenous food be improve by the use of the bile pill when the amount of fat lose in  the stool of we patient be large . instead of a average of 15 per cent be lose in the faeces , but 7 per cent escape digestion during the four day we patient take bile . the reason for this , perhaps , lie in the better digestion of fat at this time , in consequence of which the proteid element of the food be more thoroughly expose to the digestive juice . 3 . ox bile be ox bile . the amount of bile-solid secrete in the bile period be 47 per cent greater than in    40 per cent before and after . this confirm the work of Dr. Pfaff , who have have more experience with the administration of bile than I and Balch , the work of Dr. Pfaff , who have have more experience with the administration of bile than I and Balch , and the work of Dr. Pfaff , who have have more experience with the administration of bile than I and Balch , in Germany , on dog . 4 . the effect of the bile on the bowels in this case be not remarkable , although this move more satisfactorily during the bile period . in my experiment with dog my usually obtain diarrhoea when give bile . my do not feel sure , however , that this should be attribute wholly to bile medication , for the diarrhoea as a rule appear six or more day after the beginning of the experiment and the animal be then in poor condition .  Dr. Pfaff , who have have more experience with the administration of bile than I , who have have more experience with the administration of bile than I , who have have more experience with the administration of bile than my , tell my that   Dr. Pfaff , who have have more experience with the administration of bile than I , who have have more experience with the administration of bile than I , who have have more experience with the administration of bile than I have find more experience with the administration of bile than my action variable in patient . in some case more experience with the administration of bile than my be a laxative ; in the other , in which there be diarrhoea , due apparently to large amount of fat in the food , fat in  the food have the opposite effect . 5 . as to the general effect of the bile , it be observe that the urea and nitrogen be excrete in greater amount in the bile period than in either of the other . no definite conclusion can be draw from this fact , because more nitrogen be ingest during the four day  we patient take bile ; moreover , it must be bear in mind that in the result that Müller obtain in human being and dog with complete obstruction of the common duct the salol may have be a factor . 6 . the amount of urine be increase by more than 50 per cent in the bile period . it be interesting to note that the amount of urine be about the same during the bile period as in the second experiment when the bile be again take the bile natural course . Von Noorden have record a similar increase in the amount of urine follow the removal of the obstruction in acute catarrhal jaundice . the salol coating of the bile pill , which amount to one and a quarter gramme a day , be not sufficient to account for the general effect of bile on body metabolism . this be evident from the work of Kumagawa , who give two gramme of sodium salicylate daily to a dog of 25 kilo without essentially change the amount of urine secrete . on the other hand , in take the 30 pill daily we patient drink several extra glass of water , and in the second experiment we patient general condition be naturally better than at any other time . 
it seem desirable to emphasize the follow conclusion : 1 . a careful balancing of the normal acid and basis of the urine make a careful balancing of the normal acid and basis of the urine possible not merely to detect the presence of organic acid in the urine , but also to determine approximately the amount of such acid . the method recently describe by Herter and Wakeman can be recommend as secure a greater degree of accuracy , for the amount of labor involve , than any other procedure . 2 . a useful procedure for clinical purpose be a useful procedure for clinical purpose , since it be probably true that a considerable excretion of organic acid -lrb- say 15 gm . oxybutyric or more in  24 hour -rrb- -rrb- be always attend by a increase excretion of NH -lrb- 3 -rrb- . as much organic acid as correspond to 10 gm . oxybutyric acid may be excrete in 24 hour without cause a increase excretion of NH -lrb- 3 -rrb- -lrb- Case ix -rrb- . we can not therefore rely on the ammonia output to detect moderate quantity of organic acid . 3 . where organic acid be remove in considerable amount without increase NH -lrb- 3 -rrb- -lrb- Case ix -rrb- -lrb- 3 -rrb- , the acid take out other alkali , probably in some instance chiefly K. 4 . in case of diabetic coma the urine always contain a large excess of organic acid and   of NH -lrb- 3 -rrb- be usually increase to 18 to 25 per cent of the total N. 5 . crotonic acid can regularly be obtain from the urine of diabetic patient . 6 . the condition of diabetic coma be precede by a period of day , week or month , in which there be a large excretion of beta-oxybutyric acid -lrb- 20 gm . or more in 24 hour -rrb- , and in which the n of NH -lrb- 3 -rrb- -lrb- Case ix -rrb- -lrb- 3 -rrb- be largely increase . 7 . patient whose urine show or have show a large excretion of organic acid be in danger of develop diabetic coma , but the n of NH -lrb- 3 -rrb- -lrb- Case ix -rrb- -lrb- 3 -rrb- may temporarily rise as high as 16 per cent and develop diabetic coma may be delay for more than 7 month -lrb- more than 7 month -lrb- case vii -rrb- -rrb- . the persistent excretion of more than 18 to 25 gm . of beta-oxybutyric acid indicate impending coma . 8 . a patient pass 30 gm . of beta-oxybutyric acid in 24 hour may still have enough energy and strength to be about all day and perform considerable muscular work -lrb- case x -rrb- . 9 . a patient who have be excrete very little organic acid and have gain weight may within a few month show the presence of considerable quantity of organic acid , and die in typical diabetic coma -lrb- more than 7 month -lrb-  more than 7 month -lrb- case vii -rrb- -rrb- -rrb- . 10 . when the urine contain little or very little organic acid there be no immediate prospect of diabetic coma , but patient with such urine be probably liable to most of the other danger that threaten diabetic patient . the relation between the degree of the acid intoxication and the susceptibility to infection seem worthy of special experimental study . 11 . where the urine regularly contain more than 200 gm . of sugar per day there be usually considerable organic acid in the urine and large amount of acid , indicative of coma , be invariably accompany by considerable or great glycosurium . 12 . sometimes there be much sugar and little or no acid in the urine , and sometimes there be considerable acid and little sugar . these fact render little desirable to examine the urine of diabetic patient at least once a month with reference to the amount of acid excrete , for the element of the acid intoxication must be clearly separate from the element of glycosurium in we study of the progress of a case . in other word , we must recognize the acid intoxication as a important and sometimes as a dominant factor in the prognosis , and the element of  the acid intoxication should be regard even in those case of diabetes which have the clinical indication of a mild type of the disease . we may thus hope to prolong life in many instance by take precaution , as to diet and out-of-door life , which might not otherwise be deem necessary . 13 . the withdrawal of carbohydrate food frequently lead to a considerable reduction in the quantity of organic acid excrete . the reason for this be not yet clear and the phenomenon deserve careful study . 
1 . capsule make as describe above allow dialysis , when place in the peritoneal cavity , of `` capsuled '' bacillus ; it gradually increase in degree . 2 . the normal tissue , unstimulated , do not possess the power of cause agglutination ; they do not require to be stimulate by the presence of the bacterial body , but will produce they share of the agglutinin when act upon by the bacillary product . 3 . agglutination follow the insertion , in the peritoneal cavity , of `` capsuled '' bacillus ; it gradually increase in degree , of `` capsuled '' bacillus ; the insertion gradually increase in degree , and on the removal of the capsule contain `` capsuled '' bacillus ; the insertion gradually increase in degree , begin to disappear . 4 . related closely in morphology and cultural reaction , related closely in morphology and cultural reaction , do not , as a rule , produce serum which inter-agglutinate . 
the precede observation record a new instance of the occurrence of cyclic albuminurium in a otherwise apparently healthy young man . the typical course of the proteid excretion from hour to hour under various condition have be review and the typical course of the proteid excretion from hour to hour under various condition independence of the change in diet or muscular work point out . no relationship between the volume of urine eliminate and the quantity of proteid excrete have be ascertain . the most interesting feature observe be the most interesting feature observe . the attempt to refer this to attendant circulatory change in the kidney be , for the present , the attempt to refer this to attendant circulatory change in the kidney . see pdf for structure see pdf for structure . 
the conclusion which we DERIVE FROM OUR OBSERVATIONS be as follow : 1 . the excretion of inject , egg-albumen as such be in no case complete . the quantity of this retain vary from 23 to 100 % . 2 . the amount retain vary : a -rrb- directly with the slowness of absorption . this be determine by the manner of administration . b -rrb- directly with the time during which the proteid remain in the body ; and therefore inversely to the rapidity of excretion . c -rrb- inversely to the quantity of this inject ; this have however much less effect than -lrb- a -rrb- or -lrb- b -rrb- . d -rrb- with individual peculiarity ; but these be not very conspicuous . 3 . the excrete proteid coagulate at the same temperature as Albumen . 4 . injection of egg-albumen do not cause the appearance of globulin in the urine . 5 . the proportion of proteid coagulate at lower temperature be less in the urine than in the inject solution . when a solution have be heat to 73 degree before injection , the urine also do not coagulate below this temperature . 6 . egg-albumen inject into the hen be excrete as with mammal . 7 . the albuminurium last in typical case from 1 -lrb- 1/2 -rrb- to 3 day , accord to the manner of administration . the excretion begin very shortly -lrb- 7 minute -rrb- after injection . 37 per cent of the total proteid inject may be excrete in a hour . about three-fourth of the total excretion take place within the first 17 hour ; the excretion be almost complete in the next 15 hour , only trace be excrete thereafter . with hypodermic injection the amount be more nearly equal on 2 day , since the absorption may extend over 2 day . 8 . alkali-albumin , as well as alkali-albumin -lrb- from foreign species -rrb- be completely retain . a unconverted mixture of egg-albumen inject into the hen and sodium carbonate behave like egg-albumen inject into the hen . 9 . a small amount of proteid -lrb- less than 5 % -rrb- be excrete unchanged by the faeces . 10 . a variable proportion be excrete as non-coagulable proteid . the quantity of this be proportional to that of the coagulable proteid of the urine . 11 . the rest undergo complete metabolism to urea . 12 . the total nitrogen excretion be increase beyond the amount of nitrogen introduce as albumen . 13 . starvation appear to cause a increase in the ratio of the urea to the total nitrogen of the urine . 14 . the effect of intravenous injection of egg-albumen on circulation and respiration do not differ from those of a equivalent injection of the solvent . Albumen cause , however , a specific diuresis , begin 50 minute after the intravenous injection , and reach 50 minute maximum in about 2 hour . Albumen cause neither glycosurium nor haemoglobinurium . 15 . the injection of egg-albumen , alkaline egg-syntonin , or muscle extract , cause in rabbit a rise of the temperature . this begin in about a hour , usually reach this 50 minute maximum in from 6 to 8 hour , and then fall rapidly . this may in rare case persist for several day . it be indifferent qualitatively whether the injection of egg-albumen , alkaline egg-syntonin , or muscle extract be make by the jugular or the ear-vein , hypodermically , or into the peritoneum . even extremely small quantity inject into the ear-vein cause a rise of temperature of 1 to 2 degree c . the fever do not cause histological alteration in any organ examine . the injection of normal salt solution may cause a rise , but this be much smaller . 16 . the injection of egg-albumen cause but very slight histological change . the kidney be usually congest , especially in the cortex . the cell may be slightly cloudy . a slight degree of nephritis may occur , but this be not of such degree as to effect permanent lesion . muscle extract may give rise to a more pronounced parenchymatous nephritis . 17 . urethane be fatal to rabbit in dose of 0.75 to 1.0 grm . per kilo . the symptom consist mainly in a very marked fall of temperature , and in medullary paralysis . 0.5 grm . per kilo . lower the temperature 2.3 degree c. dose as small as 0.6 grm . per kilo cause very marked histological change , consist mainly in extensive granular and vacuolar degeneration of the hepatic epithelium , which be so acute as to be fully develo 
1 . the increase of conductivity produce by the saponin be due to a increase in the conductivity of the corpuscle -lrb- increase permeability of the corpuscle to ion -rrb- and not , mainly at any rate , to the liberation of electrolyte from the corpuscle and a consequent increase in the conductivity of the serum . increase permeability of the corpuscle to ion be probably cause by a `` corrosive , '' dissolve , or emulsify action of the saponin on some non-proteid constituent of the envelope or stroma . 2 . in the first stage of the action of saponin on blood -lrb- not fix by formaldehyde -rrb- there seem also to be a increase in the permeability of ion , even before any haemoglobin have be liberate . the liberation of the haemoglobin may be secondary to this , owe to the entrance , of water consequent on the disturbance of osmotic equilibrium . 3 . heating the blood to 40 degree to 45 degree c. intensify the laking action of saponin , so that a dose insufficient to cause laking at ordinary temperature may do so when the blood to 40 degree to 45 degree be heat to the temperature mention . 4 . worse conductor than the serum in which they be suspend , like red blood corpuscle , be worse conductor than the serum in which they be suspend . unlike red blood corpuscle , they show no preference for NH -lrb- 4 -rrb- cl as compare with nacl . on the other hand , the conductivity of pus be increase by the laking action of saponin , just as be the case with blood , and apparently very much in the same way , that be to say , by a action on the corpuscle and not on the serum . the fix of the pus corpuscle by formaldehyde do not hinder the laking action of saponin . 
by morphological examination and with current cultural method a clear differentiation can not always be make between Pneumococci . the chief differential character usually depend upon be the capsule of the pneumococcus . well-marked capsule , however , may occur on these organism . on the other hand , well-marked capsule may not the chief differential character by the usual method , especially when grow on artificial culture media . the usual cultural character and reaction be at best not diagnostic , and be subject to variation which may render the usual cultural character useless as evidence of specific difference . the experiment record in this paper , however , afford some evidence that there be well-marked difference between the metabolic activity of Pneumococci , which may prove useful in the differentiation of these organism . these difference in metabolism become apparent when Pneumococci these organism be cultivate in a alkaline serum medium , or in a serum medium to which the carbohydrate , inulin , have be add . Pneumococci slowly produce acid in the alkaline serum . 
from the precede I derive the follow conclusion : 1 . the disease which formerly have be describe as a form of protozoon-infection be due to a infection with a pathogenic fungus . 2 . a infection with a pathogenic fungus may primarily be either a infection with a pathogenic fungus or a pulmonary one . 3 . the lesion produce by this fungus fall under the general head of infectious granuloma and consist partly in nodule resemble altogether those produce by the tubercle bacillus and partly in chronic abscess . 4 . the adult form of the parasite be more apt to produce the sporulating form abscess , the sporulating form abscess . 5 . a pathogenic fungus be pathogenic for dog , rabbit and guinea-pig probably other animal also , and in they produce the lesion very similar to those which we encounter in the human be in the disease which formerly have be describe as a form of protozoon-infection . 6 . supurative periorchitis in guinea-pig be not pathognomonic for glander . 
the result of THIS INVESTIGATION MAY be summarize as follow : 1 . the inhalation of formaldehyde gas in even small quantity be follow by bronchitis and pneumonia . pneumonia be due to formaldehyde gas in even small quantity and not to secondary infection . 2 . formalin belong to that rare group of poison which be capable of produce death suddenly when swallow . 3 . the introduction of formalin into the stomach be follow by the production of a gastritis which vary greatly in character . the duodenum and upper jejunum may also be involve in the inflammatory process . 4 . intraperitoneal injection of formalin cause peritonitis of a fibrino-haemorrhagic character . a definite reaction be obtain a definite reaction very dilute 1-1000 be employ . in the peritoneal cavity formalin exercise a destructive action upon all organ -lrb- pancreas , liver , peritoneal fat , fallopian tube , etc. -rrb- with which the peritoneal cavity formalin come in contact and cause inflammation in these organ . 5 . the lethal dose of formalin when inject intraperitoneally into guinea pig be the lethal dose of formalin when inject intraperitoneally into guinea pig . of formalin for each 100 grm . of body weight . 6 . the injection of formalin into the lung be follow by pneumonia and bronchitis . 7 . the inflammation which follow subcutaneous injection of formalin be characterize by intense exudation . 8 . the injection of formalin into the muscle produce myositis . 9 . the injection of formalin into the anterior chamber of the eye cause the accumulation of a exudate contain leucocyte and fibrin . when formalin be drop into the conjunctival sac iritis follow and may be severe enough to destroy the eye . 10 . Formalin in whatever way introduce into the body be absorb , and be then capable of produce lesion in the parenchymatous organ . 11 . change in the liver after absorption of formalin consist of mild or severe grade of cloudy swell accompany by vacuolation of the protoplasm , change in the nucleus and leucocytic infiltration . focal necrosis may result . similar change follow the inhalation of formaldehyde gas in even small quantity . 12 . the injection of formalin into the anterior chamber of the eye or the inhalation of the vapor of formaldehyde produce cloudy swell of the parenchyma of the kidney . focal necrosis may result . 13 . pneumonia and bronchitis be find in all animal after the injection of formalin into the anterior chamber of the eye . 14 . the leucocytic infiltration which follow the introduction of formalin into the stomach into a organ have these general characteristic : the first leucocyte to appear be the first leucocyte to appear ; these be follow by the other polynuclear leucocyte ; last appear the large and small mononuclear leucocyte . similar phenomenon occur in the trachea , bronchus and lung of animal subject to formaldehyde inhalation . 15 . Formalin in whatever way introduce into the body be , directly or indirectly , the first leucocyte to appear . the tissue which be not infiltrate with the first leucocyte to appear after the injection of formalin into the anterior chamber of the eye be the tissue which be not infiltrate with the first leucocyte to appear after    the injection of formalin into the anterior chamber of the eye . 16 . animal subject to chronic poisoning with formalin administer by intraperitoneal injection develop fibrinous peritonitis , associate with marked eosinophilia . the change in the kidney and liver consist of cloudy swell of the parenchyma of the kidney , fatty degeneration , focal necrosis and leucocytic infiltration . 
the virulent cholera spirillum possess a greater number of bacteriolytic and agglutinable haptophore group , or these group be endowed with a greater avidity for unus - and amboceptor than the avirulent . a greater number of bacteriolytic and agglutinable haptophore group or the avidity of the bacteriolytic receptor possess by a bacterium be directly proportional to a greater number of bacteriolytic and agglutinable haptophore group virulence . however , the agglutinable receptor do not follow this law , this law , the agglutinable haptophore group be not necessarily present in the same proportion as the bactericidal one . while a very important factor in relation to virulence be a very important factor in relation to virulence , other phenomenon must also be consider . the virulent organism possess a greater number of toxic haptophore group than the avirulent . the binding power of the free receptor of the organism for bacteriolytic amboceptor in vitro be proportional to the bactericidal immunity produce in animal by each , which latter be in turn proportional to the virulence of the organism from which the free receptor of the organism for bacteriolytic amboceptor be extract . the binding power in vitro of the dead micro-organism of different virulence for bacteriolytic amboceptor be not in proportion to bacteriolytic amboceptor toxicity . the bactericidal immunity obtain by means of the inoculation with the dead organism of different virulence , or bacteriolytic amboceptor extract obtain by autolytic digestion , be proportional to the virulence of the living strain of the bacterium employ . with the living organism , while the bactericidal immunity obtain from the inoculation of animal with the virulent organism be greater than that produce with the avirulent , such immunity be not in direct proportion to the virulence of the bacterium introduce . these conclusion apply to the two strain of cholera spirilk employ in the foregoing experiment . whether that produce with  the avirulent will also hold good with other strain of the virulent cholera spirillum or for micro organism in general , must be decide by further experimenta work . 
the result above report lead to the conclusion that while in the degenerating cell chemical change be take place tend toward a diminution of the hexon basis as a whole , they affect the arginin especially . one may picture the process either as a partial or as a complete break down of certain proteid . material more or less rich in the hexon basis , leave behind . proteid matter poorer in the hexon basis . the meaning of chemical change be , however , obscure , and with the limited number of known fact bear upon the subject , the limited number of known fact would seem idle even to attempt to formulate a hypothesis to explain they . certain work of other investigator be , however , suggestive in this connection . Kossel and Dakin , for instance , as illustrate by Kossel and Dakin work upon the simple proteid body clupein , find that a partial destruction of the proteid molecule , involve the arginin group , be bring about by a ferment furnish by the animal organism . when subject to the hydrolytic action of clupein yield arginin in considerable abundance , clupein yield arginin in considerable abundance . but if the simple proteid body clupein be first act upon by the ferment arginase find in the liver , and then subject to acid hydrolysis , the yield of arginin be appreciably diminish . among the cleavage the component of arginin be the component of arginin , namely , the component of arginin . the cleavage would seem , therefore , as if a ferment furnish by the animal organism have loosen the union between the omithin and urea in the arginin group , so that upon subsequent hydrolysis a diminution of arginin result . in the case study by I , the cleavage may be that the condition be favorable for some such ferment action as that above describe , and hence the relatively low yield of arginin . no attempt , however , be make to ascertain if omithin be present in the urine . no attempt presence there would seem not wholly unlikely when one consider the diminish power of oxidation of the phosphorus-poisoned cell , although Thompson have show that arginin or omithin when administer to a healthy dog as food or by hypodermic injection be eliminate for the most part as urea , no ornithin be find . there might seem to be a conflict between this view and the result recently publish by Wohlgemuth , but it must be bear in mind that the influence at work cause the break down of the proteid molecule be probably quite diverse in character . Wohlgemuth have recently show for the first time that a diamino acid may actually find a diamino acid way into the urine in phosphorus poisoning . Thompson find arginin in the urine not only in rabbit poison with phosphorus but also in a patient suffering from phosphorus poisoning . on the other hand , Thompson be unable to find lysin in the urine . this fact be of especial interest in view of the evidence set forth in this paper that the arginin base be lose to the proteid molecule more rapidly than the lysin base . a close one be thus a close one . how much of the arginin liberate from the proteid molecule may find much of the arginin liberate from   the proteid molecule a diamino acid way into the urine be of course uncertain . much of the arginin liberate from   the proteid molecule seem reasonable to suppose that a portion of the arginin base be act upon by the arginase ferment in the manner already describe . of the seventeen to eighteen cleavage product of the proteid molecule thus far isolate , the hexon basis be among the most stable . one or more of the hexon basis have be find in practically all proteid matter thus far investigate ; in fact arginin be so uniformly present that Kossel have make the suggestion that one be one . at all event , the question may be ask , whether , if the influence at work in the altered liver tissue be of a general character cause the hexon basis , the monoamino acid group would not suffer even a greater diminution ; and since the pathological condition be undoubtedly associate with impaired oxidation , the monoamino acid group no attempt presence there would seem not wholly unlikely when one consider the diminish power of oxidation of the phosphorus-poisoned cell , although Thompson have show that arginin or omithin when administer to a healthy dog as food or by hypodermic injection should not be expect in the urine . as a matter of fact , Ignatowski find considerable quantity of monoamino acid in the urine of patient suffer from gout , pneumonia , and leukaemia , though under normal conditio 
the serum of a inflammatory exudate have the power of inhibit the action of the proteolytic ferment of the leucocyte . this anti-enzymotic power be possess by the blood serum from which this anti-enzymotic power doubtless pass into a inflammatory exudate . in the later stage of inflammation there be some diminution of this anti-enzymotic action . the anti-body contain in the blood serum from which this anti-enzymotic power doubtless pass be destroy by a temperature of 75 degree c . the proteolytic ferment of  the proteolytic ferment of the leucocyte act both in a acid and in a alkaline medium but be most efficient in the latter . the anti-enzymotic action of the blood serum from which this anti-enzymotic power doubtless pass be favor by a alkaline reaction , but be completely lose in a acid medium . 
in section of control and normal skin , the nucleus of the epithelial cell be often indented by the cell protoplasm , give they a appearance similar to those indented by Mallory 's body . the cell protoplasm would seem that if Mallory 's body be protozoan they would have be find in the section from both the living and the dead skin of scarlet-fever and measles , as they be present in the blister fluid . they absence be certainly more suggestive of a degeneration than of a protozoon . this view be also bear out by the fact that they be not find immediately after death , but be present in another specimen from the same case remove twenty-four hour later . this view would seem probable also that the body find in the blister fluid be the body find in   the blister fluid , because they be find in the antitoxin rash as well as in the case of scarlet-fever and measles . the histological change in the skin of these two disease lead we to expect the presence of the body find in   the blister fluid both in the blister fluid and in the section from both the living and the dead skin of scarlet-fever and measles . it certainly can not be state that none of Mallory 's body be a protozoön , but it can be positively state that a great majority of they arise from degenerate cell ; and in many case , I think , it be not possible to differentiate a degeneration from a protozoön by the study of a degeneration morphology and staining reaction . the body present in the blister fluid resemble very closely those granular body find in blood under certain condition , and see in vaccine lymph and in emulsion of tissue and in exudate . I think , therefore , that exudate be for the most part , if not wholly , product of degenerate tissue cell and of leucocyte , and within certain limit specific to scarlet-fever and measles . 
the treatment of wash the erythrocyte by a heated immune hemolytic serum derive from the rabbit , and of wash erythrocyte of the sheep by a similar serum derive from the goat , render the erythrocyte more or less resistant to the subsequent action of tetanolysin . if all the serum be remove from corpuscle treat in this manner , it can be determine that some of the protection be due to the agglutination of the cell . a certain amount of the protection afford by agglutination be referable to the physical barrier which the agglutinate mass of the cell offer to the uniform distribution and diffusion of the tetanolysin . it be probable that none of the protection obtain be due to the mere union of agglutinin or of hemolytic amboceptor with the agglutinate mass of the cell respective cell-receptor ; such union would appear to leave the tetanophile receptor still unoccupied . if a residuum of serum be leave with the corpuscle which have be treat as indicate , the add protection which be acquire against the subsequent action of tetanolysin may reasonably be refer to antitoxin which be present in the residual serum . the possibility of the dissociation of a union between the tetanophile receptor and the tetanophile receptor antibody , occasion by the dilution incident to wash away the residual serum , may not be entirely ignore , but have not be susceptible to determination . the same may be say of the possibility of the dissociation of a union between the tetanophile receptor and its antibody , occasion by the dilution incident to wash away the serum that tetanolysin , have a stronger affinity for the tetanophile receptor than have the tetanophile receptor antibody , be able to displace the latter from the latter a union between the tetanophile receptor and the tetanophile receptor antibody . hence treat the corpuscle which have be treat as indicate with the immune serum do not allow one to determine the presence or absence of a antibody for the tetanophile receptor , the experiment be formulate on the supposition that such a antibody would unite with the tetanophile receptor and thereby prevent subsequent binding of tetanolysin . 
the group of dysentery organism be a large and . vary one . it may be divide , as be well know , into two main sub-group , the `` Shiga-Kruse and occasional , if not constant , inhabitant of the normal intestine and entirely distinct . if we take decide difference in agglutination , as determine by absorption , as a criterion of specificity , the latter group include at least four distinct species with a number of sub-variety and transition form . two of the above species be find among these organism or in addition maltose . the other two species be represent by the bacillus `` y '' of Hiss and Russell and the `` Flexner-Manila '' the bacillus . if we adopt Ford 's proposal , that a new species should be make for each culture show a constant cultural or agglutinative difference , a number of sub-variety and transition form would increase considerably . at the best , however , classification of bacterium be at present very artificial . although so many type appear among the '' occasional , if not constant , inhabitant of the normal intestine , '' there be no reason why occasional , if not constant , inhabitant of the normal intestine should not all be include in the dysentery group of bacillus , provide the reaction in litmus milk be typical . the most constant one which we have at present , as Duval have emphasize , be the most constant one which we have at present , but   the most constant one which we have at present , as Duval have emphasize should extend over several week in order to exclude lactose fermenter . in contradistinction to the heterogeneity of occasional , if not constant , inhabitant of the normal intestine , '' the homogeneity of the `` shiga-kruse '' type stand in marked contrast . every culture of the latter which . be test -lrb- about twenty in all -rrb- react in all media and agglutinate with all the various serum exactly alike . one be tempt to explain this diversity of occasional , if not constant , inhabitant of the normal intestine by accept the suggestion of Flexner , that occasional , if not constant , inhabitant of the normal intestine may be occasional , if not constant , inhabitant of the normal intestine . certainly Duval have isolate the `` mannit-fermenter '' from the mildest case of diarrhoea , to say nothing of the two apparently normal infant from which Duval also obtain occasional , if not constant , inhabitant of the normal intestine . furthermore , the agglutinin for the mannit group in normal blood might be account for on this hypothesis , as well as the many difference in fermentation and agglutination . for , as have be well say by Smith and Reagh , one '' should keep in mind the various adaptation in the intestine-it may be to the food remain in the large intestine , to the mucus on the surface of the epithelium , to the contents of the tubule and the larger flask-shaped gland , and further , with this progressive adaptation be associate modification of biological character which most likely involve agglutinative capacity as well . '' the fact that dysentery bacillus have not be isolate frequently from the normal intestine might be explain by Smith and Reagh habitat be possibly within the mucus tubule and Smith and Reagh number few under normal condition , for it be well know that Smith and Reagh be most frequently find in association with mucus . when abnormal condition , however , arise and the production of mucus increase , these organism would possibly multiply in number parus passu and find Smith and Reagh in a favorable position to attack any slight injury which might occur in the wall of the normal intestine . the `` Shiga-Kruse , '' or the `` Shiga-Kruse , '' or Group the `` Shiga-Kruse , type , on the other hand seem to present the character of a true parasite . only a insignificant amount of agglutinin be present for only a insignificant amount of agglutinin and that of laboratory animal , accord to most authority ; only a insignificant amount of agglutinin agglutinate alike in various immune serum ; only a insignificant amount of agglutinin have a very marked toxicity for present for     only a insignificant amount of agglutinin and that of laboratory animal ; only a insignificant amount of agglutinin have never be isolate from the normal human intestine , although a organism in some respects like only a insignificant amount of agglutinin have be describe by Ford 's as be a inhabitant of the normal intestine ; only a insignificant amount of agglutinin produce no indol ; only a insignificant amount of agglutinin split only the monosaccharid , through which only a insignificant amount of agglutinin fall in line with the conclusion of Smith and Reagh , that the less a bacillus act on sugar the more pronounced be a bacillus parasitic character . whether or not only a insignificant amount of agglutinin ever invade the blood in number be a question yet to be decide . 
1 . typical pneumococcus be present dunng the winter month in the throat secretion of a large percentage of healthy individual in city and country . 2 . a higher percentage of the atypical strain have be obtain from healthy person than from those suffer from pneumonia . in the latter case the atypical strain may have be overlook , because of the larger number of typical pneumococcus present . many of the atypical strain seem to be closely related to the streptococcus . 3 . the so-called streptococcus mucosus Schottmuller , which have hitherto be class with the distinct streptococcus , be place as a definite variety among typical pneumococcus , and it be recommend that the name be change to streptococcus lanceolatus , var , var . streptococcus mucosus Schottmuller 4 . a lower percentage of strain of pneumococcus virulent for rabbit in the dose use have be obtain from normal case by rabbit inoculation of mass culture than from hence case of pneumonia by the same method . 5 . since the virulence of pneumococcus from case of human infection may be rapidly increase for a susceptible species of experimental animal by successive passage , and since pneumococcus from case of human infection be more virulent for experimental animal than be those obtain from healthy individual in city and country , therefore the virulence of pneumococcus from case of human infection be probably increase for human being ; hence case of pneumonia should be consider to a certain degree as contagious and , since the virulence of the pneumococcus may be quickly increase and since the organism be very prevalent in normal sputum , all possible measure should be take to restrict public expectoration . 6 . by repeat inoculation into sheep of a pneumococcus strain , a specific protective power of this serum for mouse be develop against the homologous strain and against certain other strain , one morphological variety -lrb-  streptococcus lanceolatus , var , var  streptococcus lanceolatus , var , var -rrb- be thus clearly differentiate from other strain . 7 . coincident with this production of protective power , a slight specific increase of the sheep serum in phagocytic power in vitro have be observe with some strain of pneumococcus from case of human infection , all strain of  streptococcus lanceolatus , var , var  streptococcus lanceolatus , var , var . mucosus , act similarly with the serum produce by the inoculation of one strain ; the strain of some other variety , however , have show no definite relationship between the phagocytic power and the serum produce by the inoculation of one strain ; the strain of some other variety . 
owe to unavoidable circumstance only a limited amount of time be available for the work on agglutination . the foregoing report be therefore preliminary only and the follow conclusion be provisionally offer : i. pneumococcus by reason of they agglutinating property exhibit a tendency to separate into numerous group similar to streptococcus . II . the pneumococcus mucosus form a distinct and consistent variety . the production by the pneumococcus mucosus and the resistance of the agglutinin produce by the pneumococcus mucosus to absorption by the streptococcus indicate a nearer relation to the former than to the latter organism . III . the agglutinating substance in the serum of immunized animal be demonstrate by absorption test to consist of specific and group agglutinin in case where specific and group agglutinin be sufficiently develop to make use of this method . iv .  the pneumococcus mucosus seem to show marked difference in  the pneumococcus mucosus ability to undergo agglutination . v . there be considerable uniformity of reaction of the various strain in low dilution , but this uniformity be not continue as the animal become more highly immunize . VI . at present it be not possible to establish a definite relation between the agglutination reaction and the other characteristic of the pneumococcus excepting in the case of the pneumococcus mucosus . 
the follow conclusion MAY be DRAWN , based upon the result of OUR research : 1 . organism of the pneumococcus or streptococcus group be present in the lung of practically all case , whether normal or show a variety of lesion ; strictly speak , they be find by OUR in forty out of forty-two case , or in 95 % of OUR series . 2 . the pneumococcus and the streptococcus be obtain in practically similar percentages-that be , in 50 % of practically all case . 3 . the pneumococcus be not obtain more frequently in the small series of patient expose for some time to hospital atmosphere ; we table show the contrary to obtain . the number of case examine be , however , insufficient , and the finding may thus be accidental , and hence of no value . 4 . the test micro-organism , namely , small portions-half a drachm or less-of B. prodigiosus , introduce into the human mouth after death , be convey to and recover from the lung of practically all case , whether normal or show a variety of lesion ; strictly speak , they be find by OUR in forty out of forty-two case by culture in a little over half of the case in which this experiment , that the cultural finding after death be no guide to the bacterial contents of the lung during life , and that any deduction make from such finding be unreliable and deceptive be try . the test micro-organism be , we believe , convey to the lung with the fluid which collect in the mouth after death , and which in many case collect just before death . the numerous manipulation entail in the removal of the body from the ward to the morgue greatly facilitate the entrance of any fluid from the pharynx and buccal cavity into the lung of practically all case , whether normal or show a variety of lesion ; strictly speak , they be find by OUR in forty out of forty-two case . the removal of the body from the ward to the morgue follow logically , from the result obtain in this experiment , that the cultural finding after death be no guide to the bacterial contents of the lung during life , and that any deduction make from such finding be unreliable and deceptive , that the cultural finding after death be no guide to the bacterial contents of the lung during life , or as to the channel , and that any deduction make from such finding be unreliable and deceptive . grant that we explanation be correct , there be every reason to believe that any of the micro-organism present in the mouth and pharynx and in many case in the stomach contents may enter the lung of practically all case , whether normal or show a variety of lesion ; strictly speak , they be find by OUR in forty out of forty-two case and , if the condition which determine the onset of lobar pneumonia in apparently healthy person be suitable , increase in number , during the time between death and the examination of the lung of practically all case , whether normal or show a variety of lesion ; strictly speak , they be find by OUR in forty out of forty-two case . there exist , perhaps , more frequently than have hitherto be suspect , a series of diplococcus , intermediate between the typical pneumococcus and the streptococcus . the diplococcus of this type have be find in forty -lrb- 40 -rrb- per cent . of many case in the stomach contents . a difficult one be a difficult one , depend , as a difficult one do , upon general cultural characteristic . no single character , such as the presence of capsule or the fermentation of inulin , virulence , etc. , have be find to be a certain criterion . the few agglutinative reaction we have make seem to show that these intermediate diplococcus , these intermediate diplococcus , have no or only slight agglutinative affinity to the typical pneumococcus . further test must , however , be make with the various method at we disposal before this statement can be accept as final . these intermediate diplococcus be of interest from the fact that these intermediate diplococcus have be find in the blood during life , and in the pial exudate of many case in the stomach contents of meningitis , endocarditis , etc. 6 . we study have throw no light whatever upon the condition which determine the onset of lobar pneumonia in apparently healthy person . moreover , we have be unable to draw the follow conclusion MAY be DRAWN , based upon the result of OUR as to the presence of pneumococcus in the lung during life , or as to the channel by which pneumococcus in the lung during life , or as to the channel gain access thereto . 
1 . in the course of experiment for obtain pneumococcus from the oral secretion of human individual , the `` plate method '' describe in this paper be find to be the most reliable method for isolate pneumococcus . 2 . a alkaline two-per-cent , glucose-serum-agar be regard as the most favorable medium for the rapid development of the colony . 3 . the morphological identification of the pneumococcus be make by means of a special capsule-stain . the recognition of the organism be accomplish with precision and reliability when present in the blood and exudate of test animal , and upon the various culture media employ . 4 . pure culture of pneumococcus could by the method describe be obtain within forty-eight hour for inoculation into animal for test of virulence . 5 . normal person often harbor the pneumococcus in normal person mouth . of the seventy-eight case examine , thirty-nine show the presence of the pneumococcus . 6 . in a second and larger series of study on so-called normal case by means of culture make from the throat on Loeffler 's medium , the organism be detect seventy-one time in 204 examination , or in 348 % . in 145 case the streptococcus mucosus capsulatus occur eight time -lrb- 5.5 % -rrb- , and the friedländer bacillus twenty-one time -lrb- 14.5 % -rrb- . 7 . certain individual may acquire certain individual they mouth in the hospital ward , and may continue to harbor the pneumococcus in they mouth for a considerable period of time . 8 . the pneumococcus may persist for day or week in the mouth of patient who have recover from pneumonia . 9 . from a study of patient in the hospital ward , certain conclusionsin regard to communicability be draw . `` normal '' individual , in whose mouth the pneumococcus be repeatedly find to be absent , may acquire the organism by association with pneumonia or `` positive normal '' case . the handker-chiefsand dish of pneumonia and `` positive normal '' case be to be regard as some of the means of transference of the organismfrom person to person . the lip of drinking-cup and the sputum or saliva in sputum cup be find to contain living and virulent pneumococcus . 10 . certain characteristic morphological type of the pneumococcuswere regularly meet with in a study of patient in   the hospital ward . these include the following : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the typical , -lrb- 2 -rrb- the small , the small the small . 11 . Pneumococci in the mouth of `` normal '' individual possess the morphological and cultural property which be characteristic of the same organism when isolate from other source . 12 . all pneumococcus possess the power of ferment inulin with the formation of acid , even if not in all generation . but this hold true only when the inulin serum-water medium as modify by the writer be use . 13 . a certain configuration of the colony , designate by the term `` ring-form , '' when present be present . 14 . the percentage of virulent pneumococcus present in the mouth of normal person be 79 ; in case of pneumonia , 77 . 15 . with the pneumococcus , should be distinguish from the streptococcus mucosus capsulatus . 16 . there be doubtful diplococcus of atypical morphology which can be group neither with the pneumococcus nor with the streptococcus , although neither with the pneumococcus nor with the streptococcus possess many feature in common with both . 17 . the streptococcus mucosus capsulatus belong to a group which be related to , but distinct from , the pneumococcus . 18 . morphological character and animal test be of greatest value in the morphological identification of  the pneumococcus . by the employment of suitable culture media it be possible , in most instance , to recognize the pneumococcus by the pneumococcus morphology alone . the chief cultural test be the chief cultural test the chief cultural test the chief cultural test . 19 . all pneumococcus , irrespective of      the chief cultural test source , be agglutinatedby means of pneumococcus immune serum . 20 . a immune pneumococcus serum be find capable of agglutinate various pyog 
the work carry on under the auspices of the Medical Commission for the investigation of acute respiratory disease , at the the Bacteriological Laboratory of the College of Physicians , Columbia University , have consist principally of a comparative study of the morphology , growth character , they fermentative activity , and agglutination reaction of pneumococcus and ally these organism . these organism be from two chief source : -lrb- a -rrb- from the mouth and naso-pharynx of supposedly normal person and person suffer from minor inflammation of the naso-pharynx , and -lrb- b -rrb- from definitely definitely pathologic source , such as pneumonic sputum , pneumonic lung , such as pneumonic sputum , pneumonic lung , empyaema , the circulate blood of pneumonia patient , septicaemia , meningitis , and various minor lesion , usually due to infection with pneumococcus . one of the principal object of a comparative study of the morphology , growth character , fermentative activity , and agglutination reaction of pneumococcus be to make a careful comparison , in the light of the most recent knowledge of the biology of the pneumococcus and by the aid of the latest biological and technical method , of the series of organism , not to be distinguish by morphological character or by any physiological peculiarity from true pneumococcus from two chief source : -lrb- a -rrb- from the mouth and naso-pharynx of supposedly normal person and person suffer from minor inflammation of the naso-pharynx , and thus to determine definitely the true nature of pneumococcus-like organism occur in the mouth of supposedly normal person and person suffer from minor inflammation of the naso-pharynx . the the second and equally important object , ultimately dependent , however , upon the solution of the first , be the determination of the frequency of occurrence of typical pneumococcus in apparently healthy individual . the investigation detail in the present paper have deal chiefly with the first problem and incidentally with the the second , and lead to the follow conclusion : -lrb- a -rrb- that organism , not to be distinguish by morphological character or by any physiological peculiarity from true pneumococcus , not to be distinguish by morphological character or by any physiological peculiarity from true pneumococcus derive from definitely  definitely pathologic source , such as pneumonic sputum , pneumonic lung , such as pneumonic sputum , pneumonic lung , occur with frequency in the mouth of healthy person and those suffer from slight inflammation of the naso pharynx , and that the only permissible and legitimate conclusion be that these organism be true pneumococcus . -lrb- b -rrb- that there be other organism in the mouth of  supposedly normal person and person suffer from minor inflammation of the naso-pharynx and from pathologic source that morphologically or by stain agglutination reaction of pneumococcus be not definitely to be distinguish from pneumococcus , and can only be recognize by a careful study of pneumococcus fermentative activity and agglutination reaction of pneumococcus . these organism be these organism . -lrb- c -rrb- that the organism know as streptococcus mucosus be at time find in cultivation from the mouth of apparently healthy individual , and that , although the organism know as streptococcus mucosus show certain peculiarity distinguish the organism know as streptococcus mucosus from the typical pneumococcus , the organism know as streptococcus mucosus be probably very closely related to , and a variety of , this species . 
I . in moist sputum keep in the dark at room temperature eleven day be eleven day , though considerable variation may be note in different specimen of sputum . in the same sputum keep at o degree c. thirty-five day be thirty-five day . in sputum keep at room temperature and in a strong light  eleven day live less than five day . II . in dry sputum -lrb- a -rrb- in the dark  eleven day live on a average thirty-five day ; thirty day , thirty day ; thirty day . III . in powdered sputum even when keep in the dark the death of  eleven day take place in from one to four hour . when expose to sunlight death occur within a hour . iv . no important difference be note in  eleven day when dry on glass , tin , or wood . on cloth eleven day be usually slightly longer than on non-absorbing surface . V. Sprayed sputum particle remain in suspension for twenty-four hour , but all mass of a size sufficient to contain bacterium settle at a rate of about 40 cm . per a hour . VI . when the sputum be spray the organism rarely survive for more than a hour , and often die in less time . the substance upon which V. Sprayed sputum particle fall make but little difference in  thirty-five day . on cloth a slight prolongation be occasionally note , due perhaps to the slow dry . vii . the mucus of the sputum exert a destructive action on  eleven day . viii . exposure of bacterial spray to sunlight while in suspension result in the destruction of  eleven day within more than a hour . 
it will be SEEN FROM the above that WE HAVE study the condition associate with the deposit of CALCAREOUS SALTS : -lrb- I -rrb- in connection with normal and pathological ossification , and -lrb- 2 -rrb- in pathological calcification as exhibit in -lrb- a -rrb- atheroma of the vessel ; -lrb- b -rrb- calcification of caseat tubercular lesion ; -lrb- c -rrb- calcification of inflammatory new growth , and -lrb- d -rrb- degenerate tumor ; and we have induce experimentally deposit of calcareous salt in the lower animal : -lrb- a -rrb- within celloidin capsule contain fat and soap ; -lrb- b -rrb- in the kidney , and -lrb- c -rrb- in connection with the fat necrosis . I . we have find that bone formation and pathological calcareous infiltration be bone formation and pathological calcareous infiltration . in the former there be no evidence of associate fatty change , and the cell associate with the process of deposition of calcium be functionally active . in the latter there be a antecedent fatty change in the affect area , and the cell associate with the process of deposition of calcium involve present constant evidence of degeneration . the view that would seem to account best for the change observe in the latter case be that with lowered vitality the cell associate with the process of deposition of calcium be unable to utilize the product bring to themselves in the cytoplasm with the result by the blood , or which themselves in the cytoplasm with the result continue to absorb , so that the normal series of decomposition associate with themselves in the cytoplasm with the result metabolism fail to take place and hence themselves in the cytoplasm with the result interact among themselves in the cytoplasm with the result that insoluble compound replace soluble one . II . besides the fact that calcification be always precede by fatty change within the cell associate with the process of deposition of calcium , another fact should be emphasize . namely : that combination of the fat present with the calcium salt to form calcium soap tend to occur . the stage immediately precede these be difficult to follow with anything approach certainty , perhaps because the earlier stage vary under different condition . in fat necrosis , for instance , the cell affect be normally storehouse for the neutral fat , and as long as these remain healthy neutral fat alone be present in these . when these be subject to the action of the pancreatic juice with the action of the pancreatic juice fat-splitting ferment the cell associate with the process of deposition of calcium be kill and coincidently the neutral fat be decompose , the fatty acid . the fatty acid now slowly combine with the calcium salt . in degenerate lipoma the process of deposition of calcium would seem to be similar . but in other case the cell associate with the process of deposition of calcium be not obviously fat-containing in the normal state ; nevertheless prior to calcification these undergo so-called fatty degeneration , which be really a form of cell degeneration accompany by fat infiltration . as regard the source of the cell fat in general we may safely accept : 1 . the cell fat in general be transport in the blood as diffusible soap . 2 . that take up by the cell diffusible soap may either - -lrb- a -rrb- be reconvert into the neutral fat and become store in the cytoplasm as such , or -lrb- b -rrb- undergo assimilation proper , become part and parcel of the cell substance , in which case general be not recognizable by the ordinary microchemical test . 3 . if these two possibility be accept two follow that the appearance of fat and soap in the degenerate cell may be due to either - -lrb- a -rrb- absorption or infiltration of soap from the surrounding medium , the degenerate cell retain the power of splitting off the fat but be unable to utilize this in metabolism . -lrb- b -rrb- cytoplasmic disintegration with dissociation of the soap-albumen combination or , more broadly , liberation of fat and soap in the degenerate cell from the soap-albumen combination with the cytoplasm as such . the appearance see in the cell of atheromatous area indicate that the first of these do occur . Sudan III . in atheromatous area undergo calcareous infiltration we have demonstrate . the presence of soap from the surrounding medium , the degenerate cell retain the power of splitting off the fat , and this often in such quantity that these can be isolate and estimate by gross chemical method . by microchemical method also we have be able to show that after remove all the neutral fat and the fatty acid by petroleum ether there remain behind a substance give with Sudan III the reaction we associate with the presence of soap . and experimentally we have produce diffusible soap within the organism , more particularly 
from the experiment detail in this paper it may be conclude that amanita phalloide contain besides Phallin , another body of toxic nature . Phallin be thermolabile , and be destroy by the action of pepsin and pancreatin . the other toxic body be thermostable and be resistant to pepsin and pancreatin . the two substance , moreover , possess different toxophoric and haptophoric group , since a antiserum produce by the immunization of animal to the thermostable body have no neutralize effect upon phallin . the thermolable body , phallin , produce the subcutaneous oedema and haemoglobinurium , and , in virtue of the thermolable body blood-laking property , the pigmentation of the spleen . the thermostable body produce haemorrhage and necrosis , and the fatty degeneration of the parenchymatous organ . the two body exist side by side in watery extract of the fungus , but different toxophoric and haptophoric group can not be consider as two constituent of a single poison exert a variety of no neutralize effect upon phallin . to the haemolysin the name phallin have already be give by the haemolysin discoverer , Kobert . for the thermostable substance describe now for the first time , the name amanito-toxin be propose provisionally . 
in the protoplasmic fibril of the stratum filamentosum that be present normally in human epidermis , in addition to the protoplasmic fibril of the stratum filamentosum that be present normally in human epidermis , there be well develop the protoplasmic fibril of the stratum filamentosum that be present normally in human epidermis in the cell of the stratum germinativum . these fibril , that be prominent in the stratum germinativum of human epidermis under condition of increase cell activity be present in the human epidermis only under condition of increase cell activity . these fibril , that be prominent in the stratum germinativum of human epidermis under condition of increase cell activity , that be prominent in the stratum germinativum of human epidermis under increase cell activity , seem to increase in direct ratio to rapidity of cell production . the differentiation of these fibril of the stratum germinativum into the finer fibril which connect the cell of the stratum filamentosum can be observe under proper condition of growth and therefore there should be no separation of these fibril of the stratum germinativum into the finer fibril which connect the cell of   the stratum filamentosum into different group with various name . this process of fibre production by the cell of the human epidermis be analogous to increase fibre production by various other cell under similar condition , and may be of importance in identify or classify new growth of epithelial origin . 
1 . the fact describe in this paper be intend to bear upon the pathogenesis of colitis in man and animal . 2 . the toxin of the Shiga dysentery the bacillus be liberate from the bacillus through the process of autolysis . 3 . in rabbit when the toxin of the Shiga dysentery bacillus be bring directly into the luman of the intestine the toxin of the Shiga dysentery bacillus be not absorb directly in a active form by the gastro-intestinal tract ; in man , however , absorption of a active poison do take place from the intestine . 4 . the toxin of the Shiga dysentery bacillus be excrete in rabbit when the toxin of the Shiga dysentery bacillus be bring directly into the luman of the intestine , and probably in man as well by the intestine , chiefly probably by the large intestine , which be injure by the act of elimination , which be injure by the act of elimination , react by the development of inflammation , etc. 5 . in rabbit when the toxin of the Shiga dysentery bacillus be bring directly into the luman of the intestine the characteristic action of the toxin of the Shiga dysentery bacillus depend upon the integrity of the biliary secretion into the intestine . when the bile be prevent from enter the intestine , either by ligature and section of the duct or by the establishment of biliary fistula , no lesion whatever of   the large intestine , which be injure by the act of elimination , which be injure by the act of elimination appear , or they be inconsiderable in extent . 6 . the loss of toxin through   the establishment of biliary fistula do not prevent in rabbit when the toxin of the Shiga dysentery bacillus be bring directly into the luman of the intestine the lethal effect which be cause , apparently , by a nervous poison . the tie off of the bile duct seem to prevent the passage of the toxin of the Shiga dysentery bacillus , in amount sufficient to cause the large intestinal lesion , into the blood . the liver , therefore , in this condition tend to hold back the toxin from the general circulation . 7 . the peculiar effect of the toxin on the large intestine in rabbit when the toxin of the Shiga dysentery bacillus be bring directly into the luman of the intestine be not produce at once , but would appear to depend upon successive act of excretion of a nervous poison by the bowel . 8 . the establishment of biliary fistula reduce the intensity of action of corrosive sublimate upon the large intestine in rabbit when the toxin of the Shiga dysentery bacillus be bring directly into the luman of the intestine ; and the lesion of ricin poisoning in these animal be also modify by this operation . 9 . the toxin of the Shiga dysentery bacillus be destroy by peptic digestion , and also , though probably more slowly , by tryptic digestion . the absence of power of the toxin to cause poisoning in rabbit when the toxin of the Shiga dysentery bacillus be bring directly into the luman of the intestine , be not explain by the destructive action of trypsin . 10 . the character of the histological change in the caecum of rabbit when the toxin of the Shiga dysentery bacillus be bring directly into the luman of the intestine cause by the dysentery toxin point to a action upon the substance and not primarily upon the surface of the intestine . 
acid , alkali , salt , glucoside , and certain toxin diffuse more quickly into 0.9 per cent . salt solution than into agar-agar and gelatin suspension . the inhibitory effect of the colloid grow with increase in the concentration . in the case of gelatin the degree of diffusion be approximately in inverse proportion to the square root of the concentration . agar-agar in strength up to 2 per cent . inhibit far less than gelatin in 10 per cent . suspension ; and the difference in degree of inhibition exercise by 0.5 per cent . and 2 per cent . agar-agar be a small one . haemolytic substance diffuse from gelatin into agar-agar in strength up to 2 per cent . more slowly than from saline into agar-agar . but the velocity of diffusion from agar-agar into gelatin be greater than from saline into gelatin . the effect of difference in concentration of the haemolytic agent vary accord to the haemolytic agent and the manner of concentration of the haemolytic agent salt solution . when the haemolyser be dissolve in salt solution the diffusion of 1/100 N. and 1/1000 N. solution -lrb- saponin -rrb- be almost identical ; while with solanin the stronger solution diffuse faster . when the haemolyser be dissolve in the colloid diffusion into fluid media be nearly proportional to the concentration of the haemolytic agent . the velocity of diffusion into and from the colloid be in general proportional to the square root of the time . acid alkali salt glucoside act in a manner which be in agreement with this rule . cobra lysin and tetanolysin do not act in conformity with this rule . cobra lysin appear to diffuse into the colloid , proportionally , than cobra neurotoxin , and tetanospasmin more slowly than tetanolysin . the biological method describe in this paper for study diffusion in the colloid be applicable to haemolytic and some other toxic substance , and , with accuracy possibly only to such substance possess relatively simple composition . since all diffusion in the living body take place within colloidal media of different concentration , the living body would seem desirable to perfect method through which the interaction of toxic chemical and the fluid and cell of the living body may in a manner be imitate in vitro . through this mean we knowledge of toxicology may well be extend . 
in ADDITION to the result bring OUT in the separate section I wish to DIRECT ESPECIAL ATTENTION to the follow conclusion : -lrb- 1 -rrb- in ten case of cheyne-stokes respiration observe clinically , the alternate period of respiratory activity and apnoea be associate with traube-hering wave of the blood pressure . ten case of cheyne-stokes respiration may be separate into two group characterize by the relation of the respiratory change to the change of the blood pressure . in one group the period of respiratory activity be associate with a rise of the blood pressure the blood pressure with a fall ; in the other group , the reverse relation exist . the former group include two case of cheyne-stokes respiration occur with increase intracranial tension ; the latter contain eight case with cardiac and arterial disease . -lrb- 2 -rrb- by means of cerebral compression , periodic respiration may be produce experimentally , and the relation of the blood pressure change to the respiratory variation be the relation of the blood pressure change to the respiratory variation as in the clinical case with increase intracranial tension , namely , a rise of pressure with each group of respiration and a fall with each period of apnoea . in the experiment , during each respiratory group , the blood pressure rise above the line of intracranial tension and with each period of apnoea each period of apnoea fall below the line of intracranial tension . with the disappearance of the relation of the blood pressure change to the respiratory variation , the periodicity of periodic respiration likewise disappear . it be probable that the same relation between the blood pressure and intracranial pressure exist when cheyne-stokes respiration occur clinically in association with increase intracranial tension . -lrb- 3 -rrb- disappearance of the periodic respiratory activity in the clinical case with   increase intracranial tension of both group be accompany by disappearance of the blood pressure . -lrb- 4 -rrb- the blood pressure can not be regard as a mechanical effect of the periodic respiratory activity in   the clinical case with   increase intracranial tension ; on the contrary the latter must be due to the change of  the blood pressure pressure , or both phenomenon may be referable to a common cause . -lrb- 5 -rrb- cheyne-stokes respiration in state of increase intracranial tension , with blood pressure wave rise and fall above and below the line of intracranial tension , be due to periodic activity of the respiratory , vasomotor , and cardio-inhibitory centre , the underlie cause of which be a alternate anaemia and blood supply to the medullary centre . the vasomotor centre , as the result of periodic increase and decrease of the stimulus , show periodic variation in the vasomotor centre the periodic respiratory activity in   the clinical case with   increase intracranial tension . the vasomotor centre be stimulate to greater activity during the period of anaemia , and partially relax with each period of a alternate anaemia and blood supply to the medullary centre . during the period of anaemia , the respiratory centre lose the respiratory centre irritability for the act stimulus , and be therefore apnoeic . the respiratory centre be finally stimulate to activity , either as a result of a increase in the respiratory centre irritability from a precede rise of the blood pressure , or from a great increase in the respiratory stimulus . the cardio-inhibitory centre be stimulate by the period of anaemia . this stimulation cause slowing of the pulse , which pass off to a considerable extent with the following period of a alternate anaemia and blood supply to the medullary centre . -lrb- 6 -rrb- cheyne-stokes respiration have heretofore be regard as always the manifestation of the same condition and capable of the same explanation ; the result of this work , on the contrary , show that two distinct group of case may be recognize , depend upon the relation of the blood pressure change to the periodic respiratory activity in   the clinical case with   increase intracranial tension . -lrb- 19 -rrb- -lrb- 7 -rrb- the medullary centre show great difference in two distinct group of case susceptibility to anaemia . the respiratory centre be very susceptible to a much reduce blood supply ; the respiratory centre its irritability be rapidly reduce or lose upon the occurrence of marked or complete anaemia , and be rapidly regain when a alternate anaemia and blood supply to the medullary centre be renew if the anaemia have not be maintain too long . the effect of a considerable anaemia upon the respiratory centre be entirely different from that of a normal or somewhat reduce supply of blood which be more venous than normal , that be , contain more carbon dioxide and less oxygen , such as occur with o 
1 . the action of different antivenin be highly , although not absolutely , specific for the venom for which different antivenin be prepare . the antivenomous effect be demonstrable by experiment on toxicity -lrb- in vivo -rrb- and on haemolysis -lrb- in vitro -rrb- . 2 . anticrotalus and antimoccasin serum possess therapeutic property of high degree . by vivo employment before the stage of extreme prostration have be reach , poison guinea-pig can be save . 3 . the standardization of different antivenin must be make separately for the antitoxic and antihaemolytic action , since these do not bear a constant and invariable relation to each other . 
intraspinal injection of magnesium sulphate , in dose which do not affect the respiratory centre or other vital function , be capable of abolish completely all clonic convulsion and tonic contraction in case of human tetanus , and experimental tetanus in monkey . the relaxing effect of intraspinal injection of magnesium sulphate , in dose which do not affect the respiratory centre or other vital function may last twenty-four hour or longer . in experimental tetanus in monkey early intraspinal injection of magnesium salt be capable of retard the progress and development of the tetanic symptom . 
blood serum contain normally certain principle which inhibit serum haemolysis by interfere with the action of complement . in the case of most serum the anticomplementary action appear only after heat to 56 degree c. or higher . the inhibit action of this principle be direct against alien as well as native complement , and be non-specific in character . the inhibit action of this principle would appear as if the inactivation of the serum be due to a partial liberation of the antilytic principle which just about suffice to neutralize the action of the native complement . as the temperature of the serum be raise , up to a certain point , more and more of the antilysin , which for convenience have be denominate `` protectin , '' be set free until the serum come to contain a overplus , in excess of the quantity neutralize a overplus own complement , which be capable of interfere with the action of additional native or alien complement . serum heat to 90 degree c. be less antilytic than serum heat to 70 degree c. , either because the antilysin , which for convenience have be denominate `` protectin , '' have enter into new , more stable compound which prevent the action of additional native or alien , or , as be more probable , because of a partial liberation of the antilytic principle which just about suffice to neutralize the action of the native complement from the serum of a second group of principle in alien as well as native complement , and be non-specific in character , or indirectly by increase the power of serum haemolysin -lrb- auxilysin -rrb- . this latter action tend to mask and to suppress the inhibitory influence of the antilysin , which for convenience have be denominate `` protectin , '' . the antilysin , which for convenience have be denominate `` protectin , '' be remove from serum by digestion with many kind of blood corpuscle which , apparently , absorb the antilytic principle which just about suffice to neutralize the action of the native complement . while , by reason of this treatment , the serum be deprive of the serum inhibitory power , blood corpuscle have acquire greater resistance to serum haemolysin -lrb- auxilysin -rrb- . by treat blood serum and corpuscle with ether the antilysin , which for convenience have be denominate `` protectin , '' can be extract . the ethereal extract , free from lecithin and certain related body , contain the antilysin , which for convenience have be denominate `` protectin , '' in a concentrated but not in a pure form , which can now be take up in saline solution in which the ethereal extract dissolve . the saline solution of the antilysin , which for convenience have be denominate `` protectin , '' , which for convenience have be denominate `` protectin , '' behave in all respects like the native antilytic serum except that the saline solution of  the antilysin , which for convenience have be denominate `` protectin , '' , which for convenience have be denominate `` protectin , '' be uninfluenced by temperature of 90 degree c. or even higher temperature . Protectin inhibit serum haemolysis directly by neutralize complement and indirectly after absorption by blood corpuscle by increase complement and indirectly after absorption by blood corpuscle greater resistance . hence it be highly probable that the antilytic principle of heated serum and protectin extract from blood serum and corpuscle with ether be the antilytic principle of heated serum and protectin extract from   blood serum and corpuscle with ether . thermostability be one of the characteristic property of protectin . blood serum and corpuscle with ether , first dry , may be heat to 150 degree c. without lose the protect principle , and the antilytic principle which just about suffice to neutralize the action of the native complement persist in such heated product for at least two year . Protectin in solution be unaffected by a temperature of 100 degree c. maintain for one hour , and suffer only slight reduction in activity at the expiration of two hour ; while temperature range from 135 degree to 150 degree c. bring about marked reduction in protective power . as these alteration be produce by high temperature the reaction of the solution change from acid , through neutral , to alkaline . 
1 . bacillus malleiand 1 poison produce a variety of vascular lesion in the rabbit and the guinea pig . 2 . the type of the lesion depend upon , -lrb- b -rrb- the sex of the animal and -lrb- c -rrb- the degree of acquire immunity , -lrb- b -rrb- the sex of the animal and -lrb- c -rrb- the degree of acquire immunity . 3 . the vascular change of a proliferative and degenerative nature produce by the slow action of the glander poison in rabbit and guinea pig be analogous to the vascular lesion cause by sub-acute glander infection in man . 4 . the most common site of the glander vascular lesion of animal and man be the peripheral vessel , and especially the smaller visceral artery . 5 . the aorta be a less common site of the experimental lesion . 6 . the glander vascular lesion of animal and man produce experimentally by bacillus malleus and bacillus malleus 1 poison consist of three process , -lrb- a -rrb- exudation , -lrb- b -rrb- proliferation , -lrb- c -rrb- degeneration . 7 . the lesion produce by sub-acute glander in man consist of two process , proliferation and degeneration . 8 . the primary reaction of the vessel in experimental animal and in sub-acute human glander consist of a proliferation of the endothelium of the intima . 9 . the first degenerative change observe in experimental animal and in sub-acute human glander occur in the `` innermost layer '' of the media and not in the so-called '' middle zone . '' 10 . the cause of the degenerative change in the inner layer of the media appear to be interference with the nourishment of the circular muscle fibre of the media by a proliferation of the endothelium of the intima . 
the injection of rabbit ' placenta into rabbit ' produce no isoprecipitin . from the incomplete experiment perform the incomplete would appear that placental injection into animal of the same species cause no change in the generative organ . further research into this question will be pursue . the injection of human placental nucleo-proteid , prepare from placental tissue make nearly blood free , do not produce a antiserum . this result confirm the conclusion of Pearce and Jackson , that nucleo-proteid act merely as mild toxic agent , without specific quality . the injection of human placental nucleo-proteid , prepare from placental tissue make nearly blood free , into rabbit ' , of human placental tissue , render practically blood-free , fail to produce any specific reaction . this confirm the view that the serum reaction follow the injection of cell into a foreign organism be largely due to the blood contain in the inject tissue . the injection into rabbit ' , of the human placenta , make nearly blood-free , produce a weak '' human reaction '' which can be demonstrate by the reaction for precipitin , deflection of complement , agglutinin , and hemolysis . no specific placental reaction can be show . this be in strict accord with the view that cytotoxine be not specific ; that there be no morphological specificity . the anti-serum obtain show no cytolytic action ; therefore no specific syncytiolytic action could be demonstrate . if the information obtain in this investigation be apply to the theory of Halban , it will be note that no experimental proof of the specific action of placental tissue upon the female generative organ could be demonstrate . the number of experiment perform , bear upon this one point , be however too few to permit of a definite and final opinion . the work deal with Veit 's ingenious hypothesis be more complete and carry out by many method , which would necessarily act as a check upon one another . as the result of all these experiment be in complete harmony , I feel justified in make a positive statement that no experimental proof of a specific placental immune reaction can be demonstrate by we present biological method . whether Veit 's ingenious hypothesis , thus deprive of Veit 's ingenious hypothesis biological proof , must in consequence be discard , be a question which I do not consider I competent to answer . 
Eosin , if present in  Eosin , if present in culture contain tetanus spore contain the tetanus spore , prevent the germination of these spore when Eosin concentration -lrb- in glucose bouillon -rrb- reach 0.2 per cent . when the eosin concentration sink to 0.01 per cent. , the germination of these spore when Eosin concentration -lrb- in glucose bouillon -rrb- reach 0.2 per cent be no longer inhibit , but the vegetative bacillus develop from the tetanus spore execute a highly restrained form of multiplication . when the eosin concentration sink to 0.001 per cent. , vegetation and multiplication of the vegetative bacillus develop from  the tetanus spore become more active , but no new spore be form even after long period of time . with glucose agar the eosin concentration be not until the concentration of Eosin , if present in culture contain tetanus spore fall to .05 per cent . that sporulation again appear . at the concentration of     Eosin , if present in culture contain tetanus spore , very few spore be form ; but as Eosin sink lower and lower , sporulation become more active , until with 0.001 per cent . the concentration of     Eosin , if present in culture contain tetanus spore be essentially of normal degree . in concentration of 0.003 per cent. , eosin prevent perfect segmentation of the multiply bacillus , with the result that , finally , long and convoluted thread of the multiply bacillus be produce . the spore which be form in a medium contain 0.01 per cent . of eosin be often situate at the centre and not at one pole of the vegetative bacillus develop from  the tetanus spore . Eosin in a strength of 2 per cent . be capable of destroy the vegetative bacillus develop from  the tetanus spore , if the contact be the contact the contact . place this latter mixture of bacillus and eosin in the sunlight greatly hasten the bactericidal effect , and the vegetative bacillus develop from  the tetanus spore be find to be incapable of growth at the end of several hour . Eosin in high concentration be not capable of kill the tetanus spore , even after long exposure to sunlight -lrb- thirty hour -rrb- . the toxin production of tetanus bacillus grow in eosinized culture media diminish as the concentration of the eosin increase . the bactericidal effect be bring about partly by the restrain action of the dye on vegetation , and partly by the bactericidal effect detoxicate action upon the poison. , the toxin-producing power and the virulence of tetanus bacillus grow in eosinized culture media be not permanently modify by contact with eosin for a long period , or by successive cultivation in eosinize eosinized culture media . Eosin be likewise capable of restrain the vegetation of the tetanus spore in the animal body . in spore thread insert beneath the skin of rat , and surround with eosin in solution , a very restricted vegetation take place . if the injection of eosin be repeat . vegetation soon cease and the vegetate the multiply bacillus degenerate and disappear . the ungerminated tetanus spore remain alive in a latent condition indefinitely in the heal wound beneath the skin of rat . these spore when Eosin concentration -lrb- in glucose bouillon -rrb- reach 0.2 per cent do not lose power to grow outside the animal body , or inside the body of animal under favorable condition , or to produce toxin in a characteristic manner .

the bacillus of the glander the bacillus of glander may be so modify in virulence as to produce experimentally the lesion . the highly virulent culture cause primary necrosis and disintegration of the tissue follow by the invasion of the injured area by polymorphonuclear leucocyte . the bacillus of moderate virulence give rise to a primary lesion of a acute inflammatory nature in which the cell show no evidence of necrosis or disintegration . the attenuate the bacillus of moderate virulence produce primary tissue proliferation with the formation of epithelioid and giant cell . there be every grade of lesion between the acute exudative and the chronic proliferative depend upon the toxicity of the culture . the glander lesion whether exudative or proliferative be the glander lesion whether exudative or proliferative . the strong toxin of the glander bacillus cause degeneration or necrosis of cell and exudation , while the attenuate the bacillus of moderate virulence dilute and weak toxin produce proliferation . the giant cell of the glander the bacillus of glander undoubtedly originate from the endothelial cell of the blood and lymph channel and be form by division of the nucleus of the endothelial cell of the blood and lymph channel by cell fusion . Histologically the glander lesion whether exudative or proliferative result from the culture of a low degree of virulence be proliferative and be analogous to tuberculosis ; the lesion be focal and bear a intimate relation to the glander the bacillus of glander . 
from these result it be permissible to draw the follow conclusion which may be use to explain certain phenomenon associate especially with the onset of acute pancreatitis . 1 . the sudden marked collapse of acute pancreatitis have as the sudden marked collapse of acute pancreatitis most important cause a toxin or toxin derive from break down pancreatic tissue . a toxin or toxin derive from break down pancreatic tissue a toxin or toxin derive from break down pancreatic tissue seem to be most powerful in the stage of degradation just after the disappearance of the biuret reaction and be probably of the nature of aromatic and amino-compound . 2 . there be various contribute factor of toxic action as peptone and trypsin , but these be to be regard as of secondary importance . 3 . mechanical irritation as stretch of the peritoneum and irritation of the caeliac plexus be a secondary cause . 4 . the glycerine produce through the action of steapsin can not be regard as a important cause of collapse . 
fibrinous pleurisy produce by a sterile inflammatory irritant offer opportunity for study of the part take by enzyme of leucocyte in the resolution of a fibrinous exudate . when turpentine be inject into the subcutaneous tissue of the dog , a abscess result , but when a equal quantity of turpentine be inject into the pleural cavity , there be abundant exudation of coagulable fluid and the serous surface be cover by a layer of fibrin . Accumulation of no fluid reach a maximum at the end of three day , and then gradually subside , so that at the end of six day , in most instance , the pleural cavity contain no fluid . Fibrin , though diminish in amount at the time when fluid have be absorb , be still present , and gradually disappear ; at the end of two or three week the pleural cavity have return to the normal , save for a few organize adhesion . Turpentine inject into the right pleural cavity may cause serofibrinous pleurisy on the left side ; this inflammation may reach a maximum intensity at a time when pleurisy on the right side be subside . during the early stage of inflammation fibrinous exudate , free from the serum by wash in salt solution , undergo digestion when suspend in a alkaline -lrb- 0.2 per cent . sodium carbonate -rrb- or in a acid medium -lrb- 0.2 per cent . acetic acid -rrb- . at the end of five day , at a time when fluid be disappear from the pleural cavity , digestion fail to occur in a alkaline medium , but occur with much activity in the presence of acid . during the first stage of the inflammatory reaction , when fluid be abundant and the fibrin which be present digest in alkali , thus indicate the presence of leucoprotease , polynuclear leucocyte be very numerous in the mesh of the fibrin which be present digest in alkali , thus indicate the presence of leucoprotease . in the second stage , the exude fibrin contain only one enzyme digest in the presence of acid . at a time when fluid be disappear from   the pleural cavity polynuclear leucocyte have disappear and only mononuclear cell be embed in the fibrin which be present digest in alkali , thus indicate the presence of leucoprotease . Products of proteolytic digestion , namely , peptone and albumose , absent in the exude fluid during the first day or two day of inflammation , be present after three day and be find in less quantity at a later period . the exude fluid during the first day do not at any stage of the inflammatory reaction lose the exude fluid during the first day spower to inhibit both enzyme contain in polynuclear leucocyte . a fibrinous exudate remain alkaline throughout the period of inflammation , but a fibrinous exudate alkalinity be less than that of the blood and diminish slightly with the progress of inflammation . since the acid , which in vitro favor the action of only one enzyme digest in    the presence of acid , present alone during the second stage of the inflammatory reaction , do not occur in the body , the possibility have suggest the action of  only one enzyme digest in    the presence of acid that carbon-dioxide bring only one enzyme digest in    the presence of acid into action . if carbon-dioxide be pass through normal salt solution in which strip of such fibrin be suspend , digestion be greatly hasten . the normal inhibition exert by blood serum upon only one enzyme digest in    the presence of acid be overcome by carbon-dioxide and in the presence of a small quantity of blood serum , carbon-dioxide cause greater enzymotic activity than in the presence of salt solution alone . 
if we glance again at the classification propose by Andrewes and Horder we be strike at once by the fact that no hard and fast difference in fermentative property characterize the various group , and that the author prefer to have recourse to the most frequent habitat of the organism and to chemical test , rather than to confine the author to the latter method alone . from what have be say earlier in this paper , it become clear at once that the result gain by the author be not convincing , for in the author work the author have fail to use the most favorable medium for the growth of  the organism . and thus it can hardly be doubt that different reaction might have be obtain , under the condition adopt by we . how otherwise could the fact be explain that of thirty-four of the author pneumococcus only eight fermented inulin . we have a similar experience while use the plain broth which lead we to reject a similar experience as a unfavorable medium . further , all we pneumococcus fermented lactose with great rapidity . Andrewes and Horder report that eight of they series leave lactose unchanged . take we own test into consideration we find that work with but a small number of carbohydrate we be able to find six different variety of streptococcus among only 33 pathogenic strain . which of the various substance be to decide we in the grouping of the organism ? would we not find even greater variation from the most common type -lrb- see no. 4 in table -rrb- if we be to extend we own test over a larger series of chemical agent ? these question be difficult to answer and only extend experimentation with a great many streptococcus and many media will clear up the doubtful point . in conclude the most common type -lrb- see no. 4 in table -rrb- if we be to extend  we own test over a larger series of chemical agent may be state : 1 . a great many streptococcus vary considerably in chemical agent ability to produce acid from various carbohydrate . 2 . Chemical test of this kind should be make only in the media which be most favorable for the growth of the organism . 3 . the result gain by  the author give six group of streptococcus , when test upon dextrose , levulose , galactose , maltose , saccharose , lactose , inulin , dextrin and mannite , viz. : those ferment -lrb- 1 -rrb- all ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- all but mannite ; -lrb- 3 -rrb- all but inulin ; -lrb- 4 -rrb- all but inulin and mannite ; -lrb- 5 -rrb- all but inulin and lactose ; and -lrb- 6 -rrb- all but inulin , mannite and saccharose . 4 . in view of the comparatively small number of streptococcus employ be hardly warrant in make a definite classification . perhaps a larger series of test upon the media employ will enable to divide a great many streptococcus into distinct class characterize by certain fixed fermentative property . 
in normal serum of the majority of mammalian and avian blood there exist certain substance capable of activate venom haemolysin . normal serum of the majority of mammalian and avian blood be extractable from serum by means of ether , and be capable of confer upon the originally non-activating serum a power to activate venom , when mix with the latter . the ethereal extract consist of the fatty acid and soap . the fatty acid and soap , especially of the oleinic series , acquire certain characteristic of complement in general , when general be mix with serum . general be inactive without the venom in the mixture ; general be inactivable with calcium chloride , which be powerless against lecithin or lecithin compound , but effective in remove the action of  the latter ; general exhibit a tendency to go off in activity with age ; general be inactive or only weakly active at 0 degree c. , and general be extractable by ether . in test the originally non-activating serum from which the ether soluble substance be remove , it be find that no venom activate property be leave . warm alcoholic extraction of such serum yield , however , a large quantity of lecithin . in the case of non-activating serum no venom activate   appear in the ethereal extract . lecithin exist in such serum in no less quantity than in the activate kind . the addition of oleinic acid or no less quantity soluble soap to a non-activating serum , in a ratio which correspond to the percentage of fatty acid or soap contain in some of the easily activate non-activating serum , will make the serum highly active in regard to venom . in normal serum of dog there exist , besides the group of activator already mention , another kind of venom activator which have be identify as a lecithin compound act in the manner of free lecithin . a very sharp differentiation of the haemolysis produce by this activator and by the other group of activator be obtain by means of calcium chloride , which be powerless against lecithin or lecithin compound , but effective in remove the action of  the latter , which be powerless against lecithin or lecithin compound , but effective in remove the action of the latter . this lecithin contain proteid can be precipitate by half saturation with ammonium sulphate , but be perfectly soluble in water , and be not coagulate in neutral alkaline salt solution upon boil . alcohol precipitate this lecithin contain proteid ; ether do not extract lecithin from a lecithin compound act in the manner of free lecithin . non-activating serum do not contain any such lecithin compound . Lecithin contain in other serum proteid , mainly as lecithalbumin , and perhaps as contain in globulin , be not able to activate venom . this be true of all the serum with which I work ; this matter not whether these fraction -lrb- obtain with ammonium sulphate -rrb- belong to the most activating serum -lrb- dog -rrb- or to the non-activating serum -lrb- ox -rrb- . the non-coagulable portion of all heated serum contain a venom activator of the nature of lecithin . this activator be contain in a non-coagulable proteid describe by Howell which be identical with Chabrie 's albumon . as there be no ether-extractable lecithin in the non-coagulable portion of all heated serum , the activate property of heated serum must be due to this proteid compound of lecithin . that this lecithin proteid do not pre-exist in normal serum but be produce by the action of high temperature be true of all serum except that of the dog . in venom activation we know now that lecithin become reactive with venom when venom activation be transform from other proteid compound into the non-coagulable form , Chabrie 's albumon . Howell which be identical with Chabrie 's albumon view of the non-existence of the non-coagulable proteid in normal serum seem to receive a biological support from venom haemolysis . ovovitellin derive from hen 's egg be one of the best venom activator of the lecithin proteid type . the cause of venom susceptibility of various kind of blood corpuscle do not depend upon the existence of lecithin in blood corpuscle , but solely upon the amount of fatty acid , and perhaps , also , soap and fat , contain in blood corpuscle . the protection which  calcium chloride , which be powerless against lecithin or lecithin compound , but effective in remove the action of  the latter , which be powerless against lecithin or lecithin compound , but effective in remove the action of  the latter give against venom haemolysis be the protection which   calcium chloride , which be powerless against lecithin or lecithin compound , but effective in remove the action of  the latter , which be powerless against lecithin or lecithin compound , but effective in remove the action of  the latter give against  venom haemolysis . from the stroma of susceptible corpuscle   or some fat can be extract with ether . after ethereal 
opsonin whose activity be suspend by a unfavorable reaction become immediately active as soon as the reaction reveal opsonin whose activity be suspend by a unfavorable reaction become immediately active as soon as the reaction maximum action in a medium of neutral reaction . no opsonization take place in a serum which contain a amount of alkali correspond to more than 1.6 c.c. of a 1/20 N. solution , or acid more than 0.5 c.c. of this concentration per 1 c.c. of serum . of several normal blood serum titrate -lrb- lacmoid use as indicator -rrb- the average alkalinity be find to be equivalent to about 0.8 c.c. of a 1/20 N. solution . the opsonic index obtain in the native serum be not the opsonic index obtain in the native serum , but only so much as the degree of optimum of the reaction permit to come into action . estimation of the opsonic power should , therefore , be make in a medium of neutral reaction and in diluted serum . all serum have the native serum opsonic power increase by diminish the native alkalinity . opsonin whose activity be suspend by a unfavorable reaction become immediately active as soon as the reaction be bring back to the neutral point , unless the acid or alkali employ approach the strength of 1 N. , at which point the alteration become permanent . treatment of a serum with alcohol rob treatment of a serum with alcohol treatment of a serum with alcohol . the opsonic power of serum remain unaltered upon desiccation at 23 degree c . in the dry state opsonin whose activity be suspend by a unfavorable reaction become immediately active as soon as the reaction be preserve for two year . the temperature of 100 degree , 120 degree , 135 degree and 150 degree c. do not destroy the opsonin . complement of serum be also siccostabile and be preservable in that state for several month . Dry heat of 135 degree c. reduce but do not destroy the complementary power of   the opsonin . the opsonin and complement of   the opsonin regain the opsonin original thermolability when the opsonin be dissolve in a proper amount of water . lastly , it may be emphasize that opsonin whose activity be suspend by a unfavorable reaction become immediately active as soon as the reaction exhibit in opsonin whose activity be suspend by a unfavorable reaction become immediately active as soon as the reaction sensitiveness to reaction and resistance in the dry state to high temperature certain property characteristic of the ferment . 
1 . the determination of Wright 's index of the opsonic content of the blood and other fluid of the body be open to serious and in part unavoidable error and should be abandon in the determination of Wright 's index of the opsonic content of the blood and other fluid of the body present form . 2 . conclusion base upon the blood , accord to Wright 's method , be accordingly not uniformly reliable . 3 . the percentage index be a valuable check on Wright 's bacillary index , but likewise do not furnish a adequate idea of the blood , unless carry out with progressive dilution to the point of opsonic extinction . 4 . the opsonin of normal blood serum be not specific . 5 . the specificity of the opsonin in `` immune '' serum have not be satisfactorily establish , but appear probable . 6 . a opsonic immunity , in the sense of a continued high opsonic content of the blood do not exist . 7 . in the blood and exudate of infected individual substance may be present which exercise a inhibitory effect upon phagocytosis . 
1 . the liver of the dog in which necrosis have be produce by injection of haematoxic immune serum be characterize in the less marked form by a store up of nitrogen in the persist living cell , while in the diffuse form the total nitrogen content be but slightly above the normal . this last be to be explain by the great diminution in persist liver substance which limit the power of nitrogen accumulation . 2 . in all form of necrosis there occur a absolute increase of nitrogen precipitable by phosphotungstic acid -lrb- hexon basis -rrb- but the percentage increase , in relation to total nitrogen , diminish in those form -lrb- focal -rrb- in which the product of autolysis may be readily carry off by the blood stream and greatly increase in the diffuse form with large area in which the circulation be seriously impaired . 3 . although the absolute amount of nitrogen represent arginin and histidin vary , a relative increase be evident when this fraction be compare with the total diamino-nitrogen . a relative increase correspond to the degree of necrosis and attendant circulatory disturbance and indicate that in necrosis as oppose to degeneration -lrb- Wakeman -rrb- arginin be not split up by arginase . the lysin also bear a definite relation to the total hexon nitrogen . 4 . the diamino-nitrogen of the normal liver after autolysis in vitro show a slight variable increase over that of the unautolyzed , while the necrotic liver show a decide decrease . 5 . the diamino-acid nitrogen of normal horse liver be only about one half of that of the dog in which necrosis have be produce by injection of haematoxic immune serum ; the relative proportion of hexon basis be about the same . in necrotic liver with amyloid the diamino-nitrogen of the normal liver after autolysis be markedly increase which be in accord with Neuberg 's observation on the high hexon base content of amyloid . 
1 . the presence of blood serum have a decide inhibitory effect on autolysis . thus in the normal unwashed organ 100 to 300 per cent. be 100 to 300 per cent. , while in the wash the wash amount to 450 per cent . the wash necrotic liver show a increase of from 600 to 850 per cent. , while that of the unwashed necrotic be only slightly above the normal unwashed . 2 . while the initial amount of non-coagulable nitrogen vary it be greater in the wash necrotic liver show the more extensive form of necrosis . the final amount of autolysis be also the final amount of autolysis . as regard the rate of autolysis fifty per cent . of the total occur in the first day in the normal and in all type of lesion both wash and unwashed . the maximum be usually reach on the third day in the normal unwashed , while in the wash there be a continued increase to the eighth day . at this time in the necrotic liver about two to three time as much of the total nitrogen be in the form of non-coagulable nitrogen as in the normal . 3 . in the necrotic tissue the initial control show the content of the monamino-acid , with one exception , to be practically double . in in the seventy per cent be seventy per cent . of the total nitrogen against forty-six to fifty-seven per cent . in the wash normal . in all case the monamino-acid nitrogen run parallel to the non-coagulable nitrogen , but in relation to the total nitrogen relation to   the total nitrogen show a greater increase in the wash than in the normal unwashed organ . 4 . the ammonia production in the necrotic liver about two to three time show by the partition experiment be greater than that in the normal and a greater increase correspond to that of the non-coagulable nitrogen . in the experiment concern the absolute production of ammonia in the presence of blood serum a greater amount be produce in the two and five hour ' lesion than in the normal liver . on the other hand , the forty-eight hour diffuse necrosis equal the normal and the focal fall below . 5 . Arginase be obtain from normal but could not be isolate from the necrotic liver about two to three time . 6 . no constant relation could be demonstrate between the anatomical lesion in the liver and the presence of leucin and tyrosin in the urine . leucin be find occasionally in the urine , but none in the liver . on the other hand , tyrosin be constantly present in liver with diffuse but rarely in those with focal necrosis . in the instance of the forty-eight hour diffuse necrosis in which the liver and urine of the same animal be examine tyrosin be find in both . 7 . the presence of large amount of proteose in the necrotic liver indicate that the elimination of these substance -lrb- colloidal nitrogen of salkowskus -rrb- under such circumstance may account for a part of the total nitrogen of the urine usually attribute to the monamino-acid . 
1 . in focal and diffuse necrose of the liver due to haemotoxic serum there occur a increase elimination of total nitrogen with a corresponding augmented output of urea . the ammonia excretion become slightly diminish at first , but later rise somewhat above normal . the undetermined nitrogen be markedly increase . 2 . in diffuse degeneration with no necrosis on the other hand only a slightly increase output of total nitrogen be evident . a rearrangement of the urea-ammonia proportion occur in that the ammonia excretion be augmented while a increase elimination of total nitrogen with a corresponding augmented output of urea be correspondingly diminish . the undetermined nitrogen rise but little . 3 . in control experiment with normal serum no effect be produce . 4 . these result would appear to indicate that in lesion characterize by uniform degeneration of the liver parenchyma , in contradistinction to necrosis , there occur no increase nitrogen elimination but merely a disturbance of the urea-forming function of the cell without the appearance in the urine of product of autolysis . on the other hand in necrosis , of even considerable extent , the total-nitrogen be greatly augmented , as be also the rest-nitrogen ; while the production of urea , on account of the persistence of normally function liver cell , remain relatively unchanged . this `` factor of safety '' -lrb- 32 -rrb- possess by the liver be , we think , one of the most important result bring out in this investigation and must be give great weight in any consideration of the chemistry of hepatic disturbance . 
in necrosis of the liver of the dog produce by haemotoxic immune serum , the increase excretion of uric acid , purin basis and inorganic phosphorus pentoxide be the increase excretion of uric acid , purin basis and inorganic phosphorus pentoxide . 
1 . change which occur in the fat content of the liver of dog receive haemotoxic serum bear no relation to the degree of necrosis produce by this serum . 2 . a increase in water content of the tissue seldom occur , but where present be due to the nitrogenous autolysis rather than to the deposition of fat . 3 . the appearance of fat in the cell be not associate with a decomposition of the proteid component of the compound fat , but rather to a simple splitting off of the fatty radical . this be show by the slight variation occur in the percentage nitrogen of the fat-free substance . 4 . the iodine equivalent diminish as the fat content increase . this would indicate that in the fatty change which occur , the fat make    the fat the appearance of fat in the cell . 5 . the ratio of phosphorus to nitrogen in the alcohol-chloroform extract remain practically constant in all degree of necrosis . hence the substance of the protagon and jecorin type hold the same relation to the lecithin during the nitrogenous autolysis as the lecithin during  the nitrogenous autolysis do normally . 6 . in a general way a general way may be say that the result obtain in the microchemical staining of the fat with scharlach r agree with those find by chemical extraction method . 
the most marked difference , the most marked difference , between gonococcus and diplococcus intracellulan be cultural one , and consist chiefly in abundance of growth and choice of medium . relatively larger dose of gonococcus than of diplococcus be require to kill young guinea-pig , but the lesion be very similar in the two case , and both organism lose pathogenic power rapidly when cultivate artificially . agglutinin , aggressin , protective power , and the amboceptor develop in the serum of immunized animal seem to be largely common to both diplococcus and gonococcus . neither other gram negative coccus nor streptococcus pyogene have any receptor in common with intracellulari and gonococcus . 
1 . none of the extract examine be very potent in small dose . a noticeable effect , however , be produce upon the blood pressure by shark testis extract . 2 . a small dose of a five per cent . shark testis extract seem to show more pressor action than a larger dose of the same solution . 3 . the fall of blood-pressure be due to a vaso-dilation . 4 . after repeat -lrb- seven or eight -rrb- injection of almost any extract , almost any extract almost any extract almost any extract cause very little if any response from the blood-pressure . 5 . continue boil of a extract destroy the pressor substance . 6 . the depressor action be then very pronounced and especially prolonged . 7 . the depressor substance will dialyze . 8 . the pressor and depressor substance can not be separate by dialysis , because in the repeat sterilization the pressor substance disappear . 9 . the pressor and depressor substance can not be separate by absolute alcohol , as each seem to be soluble . very great , at least in the cold be not , however , very great , at least in the cold , at least in the cold . 10 . it seem impossible to separate the pressor and depressor substance by means of a difference in solubility in cold physiological salt solution , since the depressor substance be even more soluble in that solution than the pressor . and yet the depressor substance be not the depressor substance , even though it be allow to stand for some time . 11 . after cut the vagus , the recovery from the effect of the depressor substance be much more rapid than with the vagus intact . the amount of fall of blood-pressure be about equal in either case . 12 . extract of the testis and pancreas of shark ; of the testis and spleen of swordfish ; and the spiral valve of dogfish show the presence of a pressor substance . 13 . extract of the testis , spleen , pancreas and liver of shark ; of the testis , liver , spleen and kidney of swordfish , and the spiral valve of dogfish show the presence of a depressor substance . 14 . extract of shark ovary give no result . I believe , however , that if sufficient of the parenchymatous tissue of shark ovary have be obtain a result would have be give by this organ also . 
from the liver of a young man who die of typical , '' idiopathic '' acute yellow atrophy of the liver , after a illness of six week , there be isolate and identify the follow amino acid : Histidin , lysin , tyrosin , leucin , glycocoll , alanin , prolin , glutaminic acid , aspartic acid . these be find free in the extract , and presumably represent product of the autolysis of the liver cell , although the amount of soluble non-protein nitrogen present in the extract be so large as to suggest that there must be some other source for these substance . small quantity of free proteose and peptone , and of xanthin and hypoxanthin , be also find in the extract . in the insoluble protein of the liver the proportion of diamino acid be decrease slightly as compare with normal liver . the proportion of protein phosphorus be increase , probably because of active regenerative proliferation , while the sulphur be normal in amount . iron be increase because of the large quantity of blood in the liver and the hematogenous pigmentation of the liver cell . gelatigenous material be increase both absolutely and relatively , because of the loss of parenchyma and the proliferation of the stroma . the proportion of water to solid be much increase , there have be a loss of over two-third of the entire parenchymatous element of the liver . the amount of fat , lecithin and cholesterin be not far from the amount of fat , lecithin and cholesterin normal for the liver . 
1 . eosinate of thionin give very satisfactory staining for blood smear . eosinate of thionin be easily prepared and dissolve readily in methylate spirit . 2 . in the method heretofore employ for make mixture of eosin and methylene blue derivative , the eosinate of methylene violet and methylene azure be present in very small quantity or be altogether absent . 3 . Thionol and thionin be probably form in methylene blue which have be long boil with dilute alkali and silver oxide . 4 . good stain of eosin and methylene blue derivative can be obtain by a variety of manipulation . 5 . methylate spirit be more economical as a solvent for this stain and better adapt for the simple technique above describe than be methyl alcohol . there be some evidence that the staining act be of a chemical nature . 
in conclusion we MAY summarize the above biological observation in a SERIES of THESES AS FOLLOWS : 1 . the cancer cell themselves differ from other epithelial cell in respect to : -lrb- a -rrb- size relation of nucleus and cell body ; -lrb- b -rrb- power of indefinitely continue division . 2 . the cancer cell themselves differ from embryonic cell in absence of : -lrb- a -rrb- power of differentiation ; -lrb- b -rrb- power of coördination of part to whole ; -lrb- c -rrb- power of self-regulation and limit of growth . 3 . the continued development of the cancer cell themselves be subject to the following factor : -lrb- a -rrb- the inherent potential of division of the cancer cell themselves . -lrb- b -rrb- the natural resistance of the inoculate animal . the latter factor be usually regard as the index of malignancy of a tumor and be base upon the percentage of take together with the period require to kill the mouse . we experiment , however , show that the percentage of take together with the period require to kill the mouse be independent of the time factor , and indicate the presence of a third factor which may be describe as -lrb- c -rrb- the potential of `` infectivity '' of the cancer cell themselves . 4 . the infectivity of  the cancer cell themselves be characterize by more or less regular rhythm ; these must be distinguish from rhythm of growth energy of the cancer cell themselves which in all probability occur within the individual mouse . without the division energy of the cancer cell which have be describe as organism the infectivity of  the cancer cell themselves be inoperative , hence it follow that the cause of the infectivity of  the cancer cell themselves lie within the cancer cell which have be describe as organism or be constantly associate with the cause of  the infectivity of  the cancer cell themselves . 5 . the cancer cell themselves differ from other epithelial cell in respect to : -lrb- a -rrb- size relation of nucleus and cell body ; -lrb- b -rrb- power of indefinitely continue division by virtue of this potential of no infectivity . there be reason to believe that the latter be due to the action of stimulus and not to the liberation of a restrained growth power of embryonic tissue . there be reason to doubt that a initial and discontinued stimulus be responsible for these attribute of the cancer cell themselves . certain benign tumor , or vegetable gall , may be due to the action of such initial stimulus , but in    no infectivity there be no infectivity . embryonic tumor , due to embryonic cell in absence of : -lrb- a -rrb- power of differentiation ; -lrb- b -rrb- power of coördination of part to whole ; -lrb- c -rrb- power of self-regulation and limit of growth , have a high power of differentiation combine with    no infectivity the division energy of   the cancer cell which have be describe as organism , but there be no infectivity . infectivity distinguish all cancerous growth from normal epithelium and from benign tumor or teratoma . 6 . the rhythm of the infectivity of  the cancer cell themselves , erroneously regard as rhythm of growth energy of   the cancer cell themselves which in all probability occur within the individual mouse by Bashford , Murray and Boyen , appear as Bashford , Murray and Boyen do in successive batch of mouse which we may legitimately assume to have like we power , must have Bashford , Murray and Boyen cause in the cancer cell Bashford , Murray and Boyen . the cancer cell themselves , therefore , must be equivalent to else parasite , or else parasite be contain within or associate with Bashford , Murray and Boyen . 7 . upon any other hypothesis it be difficult to conceive of cell create a continual stimulus to Bashford , Murray and Boyen own growth energy , and it be still more difficult to explain the rhythm of    the infectivity of  the cancer cell themselves , erroneously regard as    rhythm of growth energy of   the cancer cell themselves which in all probability occur within the individual mouse by Bashford , Murray and Boyen , appear as Bashford , Murray and Boyen do in successive batch of mouse which we may legitimately assume to have like power of resistance . 8 . many line of evidence point to the presence of some possible organism within the cancer cell which have be describe as organism ; some organism which , act as do Plasmodiophora brassicae within vegetable cell , underlie the infectivity of the cancer cell themselves and provide the stimulus for brassicae within vegetable cell continue proliferation . upon such a assumption the numerous case of cage infection find brassicae within vegetable cell explanation . 9 . the various inclusion of the cancer cell which have be describe as organism have be disprove ; yet the analogy of club root and the many filter experiment show that the cause of infection may lie within the cancer cell which have be describe as organism . it be conceivable that , like the yellow fever organism , such a incitant may be in the protoplasm and beyond we power with the microscope to locate . 10 . the spirochaete which we have find in mouse cancer may have something to do with the infectivity of  the cancer cell themselves . the spirochaete which we have find in mouse cancer may be useful in prepare the `` soil '' in new mouse host and make the `` soil '' in new mouse host susceptible to cell growth ; or the spirochaete which we have find in mouse cancer may have intracellular stage in the spirochaete which we have find in mouse cancer life history which be too minute to be see . the rhythm of    the infectivity of  the cancer cell themselves , erroneously regard as    rhythm of growth energy of   the cancer cell themselves which in all probability occur within the individual mouse by Bashford , Murray and Boyen , appear as Bashford , Murray and Boyen do in successive batch of mouse which we may legitimately assume to have like power of resistance the rhythm of    the infectivity of  the cancer cell themselves , erroneously regard as    rhythm of growth energy of   the cancer cell themselves which in all probability occur within the individual mouse by Bashford , Murray and Boyen , appear as Bashford , Murray and Boyen do in successive batch of mouse which we may legitimately assume to have like power of resistance , may be a expression of the vitality of the spirochaete which we have find in mouse cancer or of the hypothetical ultra-microscopical organism accompanyi 
the intravenous injection of pilocarpine nitrate cause in the dog a rapid and considerable increase in the output of lymphocyte through the thoracic duct . the corresponding lymphocytosis induce by the drug in the blood of this animal be not profound , and increase cell-output with the lymph will explain a large part if not all of it . quicken lymph-flow and dyspnoeic breathing be accessory in the production of the large cell-output with the lymph , but the production of the large cell-output with  the lymph be mainly dependent on some undetermined element . the evidence point to the mechanical nature of some undetermined element . the evidence be probably to be seek in direct pressure from contraction of smooth muscle , as suggest by Harvey , but Harvey observation that atropine prevent the appearance of a lymphocytosis after pilocarpine can not be quote in proof because atropine much slow the lymph-flow , and thus decrease cell-output . these finding be in accord with the theory that make mechanical factor responsible for rapidly appear lymphocytosis . they show that there be more such factor than have be suppose . especially do they indicate that the contribution of cell through the thoracic duct may be important in the production of lymphocytosis , and be not , as be often assert , subsidiary to direct migration into the blood of cell from spleen , bone-marrow and the lymph-gland . 
OUR result MAY be BRIEFLY SUMMARIZED : 1 . the blood , soon lose the blood power to maintain the activity of the higher nervous center , and the blood nutritive property for all tissue quickly diminish . 2 . artificial fluid , as a substitute for blood , be not satisfactory . 3 . a indispensable adjunct in the resuscitation of a animal be a indispensable adjunct in the resuscitation of a animal . 4 . the heart usually continue to beat for some minute after some minute cease to affect a mercury manometer , and resuscitation of the heart be sometimes successful . 5 . the most certain method at we command be the most certain method at we command . 6 . a indispensable condition for the continue normal activity of  the heart be a indispensable condition for the continue normal activity of the heart . 7 . Anaesthetics , hemorrhage and induce current apply to the heart render resuscitation more difficult than asphyxia alone . 
on the basis of THESE FACTS WE FEEL JUSTIFIED in MAKING the FOLLOWING ASSERTION : under normal condition and during various procedure -lrb- namely , stimulation of the vagus centrally and peripherally , of the saphenus nerve centrally , and of the annulus Vieussentis , intravenous transfusion of 0.7 per cent . a reliable index of the systolic output , intra-arterial transfusion of strong carbonate , bleeding and asphyxia -rrb- the pulse pressure be a reliable index of the systolic output . 
the experiment on cerebral anaemia have enable we to duplicate , by a entirely different method , many of the result obtain by anatomical division or removal of part of the central nervous system . in some respects the method of anaemia permit of greater precision than the method of division or excision , and avoid , in great measure , the disturbance due to the wound and to the hemorrhage cause by the latter method . the method of general anaemia , as Couty point out long ago , leave something to be desire in the matter of exact localization , but this objection may be meet , in some degree at least , by appropriate method of investigation . it be desirable that the result obtain by the method of section should be duplicate by some other method in order to eliminate as much as possible the effect due to the irritation produce by the anatomical lesion . the result obtain by the method of section show , as believe , that , of the bulbar mechanism study , the most automatic be the most automatic , the vasomotor in part automatic , and the cardiac like the swallow mechanism , almost wholly dependent upon afferent impulse for the arousal and discharge of the most automatic normal activity . the eye reflex return during the resuscitation period in the animal in which the cerebral anaemia have not be too prolonged . the motor cortex lose the motor cortex excitability during anaemia , but may regain the motor cortex after the reëstablishment of the circulation . the pilomotor mechanism be disturb during the spasm which occur at a certain stage in the resuscitation . the temperature fall during the occlusion period , but rise again , often to far above normal , in the day follow the cerebral anaemia . so many disturbing factor , such as the violent muscular contraction during the spasm which occur at a certain stage in the resuscitation , enter into the problem that it be impossible to say that there be a actual disturbance of the temperature regulate mechanism although we be incline to believe that the case be the case . all the sens return , follow cerebral anaemia , but sight and hearing may afterwards fail without cause the death of the animal . the mental process may return without any apparent deficiency , if the occlusion period , but rise again , often to far above normal , in the day follow  the cerebral anaemia have be short . after longer occlusion , apparent insanity have be see , and in one case , apparent total loss of the mental process occur . the reflex excitability of the cord return rather early in the resuscitation period in the animal in which the cerebral anaemia have not be too prolonged . these reflex first involve muscle on the same side as the stimulus , and later cross to involve muscle of the opposite side . the spinal cord sometimes fall into much the same condition as that follow spinal transection , and the scratch reflex appear . spinal transection , when these reflex have appear , do not produce shock . practically all phenomenon of spinal shock may be reproduce without section of  these reflex . we conclude , therefore , that spinal shock be due more to the cut off of the reflex pathway through the higher center of the central nervous system than to the stimulation of inhibitory fiber by the cerebral anaemia . 
1 . the nodule find in the spleen be the nodule find in the spleen . 2 . the primary focus of disease the primary focus of disease , have be the primary focus of disease ; some toxin have probably produce a chronic inflammatory change . 3 . the primary focus of disease the primary focus of disease the primary focus of disease , have lose the primary focus of disease haemopoëtic power totally or to a marked degree and the spleen have revert to the primary focus of disease foetal power to form blood . 
we conclusion differ in a few point from those of we first work on this subject . we be able to sum up we observation in this series of experiment as follow : 1 . the ophthalmo-tuberculin test be of limited value in the diagnosis of tuberculosis in cattle . in some case the reaction be very slight -lrb- hyperaemia -rrb- . in other more pronounced congestion with profuse exudate be note . accuracy of observation be important . we be incline to rely primarily on the result of the first instillation of tuberculin . second instillation in a few instance elicit reaction in non-tubercular animal . 2 . in the majority of animal test the reaction increase in 2 intensity with each subsequent instillation of tuberculin . this fact indicate the development of a local hypersusceptibility or anaphylaxi associate with a partial immunity ; von Pirquet call 9 . 3 . it be possible in some case to create a condition of `` allergie '' in healthy cattle , when space instillation of tuberculin be make . it be evident , therefore , that the result of the first instillation of tuberculin should be make the only basis of diagnosis . Rosenau and Anderson -lrb- II -rrb- have recently call attention to this point in regard to the human subject . 4 . when repeat instillation of tuberculin be make on the conjunctiva at short interval -lrb- twenty-four hour , etc. -rrb- a local immunity result -lrb- no. 3d et al. -rrb- . if repeat instillation of tuberculin be separate two week or more anaphylaxi result . 5 . we , therefore , hold that if tuberculin -lrb- 0.1 cubic centimeter -rrb- be carefully instil into the conjunctival sac and if careful comparison of the instilled eye with the opposite eye show that a reaction of vary intensity result in from ten to twelve hour after the first instillation of tuberculin , the first instillation of tuberculin be present . 6 . in 7 we be incline to believe that subcutaneous tubercular injection give previous to the ocular test would slightly inhibit the ocular test . we have since become convinced that this be true only to a limited extent , and that in some case the ophthalmo-reaction be exaggerate by a subcutaneous injection of tuberculin . . the primary ophthalmo-tuberculin reaction be in direct proportion to the extent of the tubercular process in the body . the more extensive the tubercular process in the body , the more anaphylactic the animal be . this be in direct variance with the condition in the usual subcutaneous tuberculin test . -lrb- see Necropsy Report . -rrb- 8 . we be incline to believe that the ophthalmo-tuberculin test will reveal tuberculosis at as early a state as the usual subcutaneous tuberculin test . . the ophthalmo-reaction be of no value in determine whether vaccinate cattle be actively tubercular or not , or in demonstrate any hypersusceptibility in the offspring of tubercular cattle . 10 . the cutaneous test from we brief series of experiment as follow : 1 do not seem to be as accurate as the ophthalmic test . this conclusion have be reach by several investigator . 
the leucocyte of the blood of normal individual and of patient show a marked polymorphonuclear leucocytosis contain enzyme capable of digest coagulate blood serum in neutral , alkaline or acid solution . the cell in pus that be compose principally of the leucocyte of the blood of normal individual and of patient show a marked polymorphonuclear leucocytosis and the leucocyte of the circulate blood in myelogeneous leukaemia contain similar proteolytic enzyme , which act best when the reaction be alkaline . the leucocyte of the circulate blood and of the enlarged lymph node from a case of large cell , acute , lymphatic leukaemia contain no proteolytic enzyme . these large lymphocyte in acute lymphatic leukaemia can be differentiate biologically from the small lymphocyte in chronic lymphatic leukaemia which possess no proteolytic enzyme , and from the large endothelioid cell of the hyperplastic lymph gland which be proteolytic only in the presence of acid . these result seem to show that the large cell of the so-called acute lymphatic leukaemia be not true lymphocyte , but be nearly relate to the granular myelocyte and should probably be consider as the forerunner to the large cell of the so-called acute lymphatic leukaemia . 
1 . the removal of one half , two third and sometimes three quarter of the kidney substance in the dog cause no change in the general nitrogenous metabolism as determine by estimation of the total nitrogen , urea and ammonia elimination by the urine . 2 . the removal of larger amount , and sometimes the removal of larger amount , lead to the metabolism condition of starvation . the result of the gastro-intestinal disturbance constantly associate with extensive kidney reduction and not of a disturbance of general nitrogenous metabolism , however , be apparently the result of the gastro-intestinal disturbance constantly associate with extensive kidney reduction and not of a disturbance of general nitrogenous metabolism . 3 . the determination of the amount of faecal nitrogen indicate that the gastro-intestinal disturbance constantly associate with extensive kidney reduction and not of a disturbance of general nitrogenous metabolism be not due to diminish absorption ; and except in one instance there be no evidence of one instance be due to a increase elimination of nitrogenous substance into the intestine . 4 . these experiment do not support the theory that the kidney furnish a internal secretion have a important influence on general nitrogenous metabolism . at least , if such a function exist , such a function be not disturb by the kidney substance in the dog . 5 . the metabolism in excessive kidney reduction be that of inanition dependent on gastro-intestinal disturbance presumably due to faulty chemical correlation . in this connection further knowledge concern a increase elimination of nitrogenous substance into the intestine into the intestine of toxic substance be desirable . 
epithelioid cell which form the chief element of tuberculous tissue contain a enzyme which cause active digestion of proteid in a approximately neutral or in a weakly acid medium , but be inactive in the presence of weak alkali . this enzyme , present at a time when the tissue contain numerous polynuclear leucocyte resemble that this enzyme , present at a time when the tissue contain numerous polynuclear leucocyte occur in the large mononuclear cell of a inflammatory exudate and be more active than the similar enzyme of parenchymaton organ such as the liver . the enzyme which digest in the presence of acid exhibit greatest activity at a time when caseation be begin . with advance of caseation advance of caseation greatest activity at a time when caseation be begin diminish so that the tissue exhibit trivial evidence of the presence of enzyme . it be probable that complete caseation be follow by total disappearance of enzyme . tuberculous tissue contain a enzyme capable of digest proteid in the presence of alkali -lrb- leucoprotease -rrb- only during the early stage of the presence of alkali -lrb- leucoprotease -rrb- development . this enzyme , present at a time when the tissue contain numerous polynuclear leucocyte , present at a time when the tissue contain numerous polynuclear leucocyte , quickly disappear so that when enzyme digest in acid be still active , leucoprotease have disappear . the serum of a tuberculous pleural exudate obtain by intrapleural inoculation with tubercle bacillus cause slight inhibition of the mixture of the enzyme . the serum of the blood cause complete inhibition of the enzyme contain in the same tuberculous tissue . analysis of this difference indicate that the exude tuberculous serum , like the serum of the blood , inhibit proteolysis cause by leucoprotease , but fail to inhibit digestion cause by a enzyme act in the presence of acid . in testing this property of the exude tuberculous serum lymphatic gland have be use because suitable tuberculous tissue have not be available . a tuberculous pleural exudate obtain by intrapleural inoculation with tubercle bacillus produce experimentally not only fail to exert the anti-enzymotic power which be exhibit by the blood , but be the serum of a tuberculous pleural exudate obtain by intrapleural inoculation with tubercle bacillus capable of cause active digestion of coagulated proteid . normal blood serum do not digest proteid and the serum of a sterile inflammatory exudate obtain by injection of turpentine into the pleural cavity have cause very little digestion . the test which have be make indicate that loss of anti-enzymotic power and ability to cause proteolysis increase with the age of a sterile inflammatory exudate obtain by injection of turpentine into the pleural cavity . the foregoing fact offer suggestion which may serve to explain in part the nature of the tubercle and the change which occur within the tubercle . the so-called epithelioid cell of the tubercle resemble the large mononuclear phagocyte of inflammatory exudate and both contain a enzyme of the same character . it be not improbable that caseation which , like autolysis , be accompany by disappearance of nucleus be in part dependent upon the presence in the cell of this active proteolytic enzyme which be for a time hold in check . Injury to these cell , the result of imperfect vascularization of the same tuberculous tissue , may have a part in render these cell susceptible to self-digestion . change which have be observe in a tuberculous pleural exudate obtain by intrapleural inoculation with tubercle bacillus show that the anti-enzymotic property of the normal blood may be absent in the exudate of a tuberculous lesion . this loss of anti-enzymotic action , perhaps referable to change cause by product of the tubercle bacillus or partial anaemia bacillus , may favor self-digestion of the enzyme-containing cell and diffusion of this active proteolytic enzyme which be for a time hold in check . 
by a study of the enzyme contain in fibrinous exudate produce by injection of a sterile inflammatory irritant -lrb- turpentine -rrb- condition have be find in which each of two enzyme occur alone . the one , leucoprotease , digest in the presence of alkali ; the other , resemble lymphoprotease , digest in the presence of acid , yet both exhibit almost maximum activity in a approximately neutral medium , slight change in reaction increase digestion by  the one . it be probable that both the enzyme , in the body , exert both greatest activity in a approximately neutral medium , slight change in reaction increase digestion by  the one , slight change in reaction increase digestion by the one , and suspend digestion by the other . the enzyme digest in acid , present in the fibrinous exudate obtain after a single injection of turpentine , disappear when repeat injection of the same irritant transform the sero-fibrinous into a purulent exudate , and cause accumulation of leucoprotease in great quantity . 
we belief be we belief that the analysis of history of case of epidemic meningitis which have be present in this article furnish convincing proof that the antimeningitis serum when use by the subdural method of injection , in suitable dose and at proper interval , be capable of reduce the period of illness ; of prevent , in large measure , the chronic lesion and type of the infection ; of bring about complete restoration to health , in all but a very small number of the recover , thus lessen the serious , deform , and permanent consequence of meningitis ; and of greatly diminish the fatality due to the disease . 
Vaquez and Aubertin advance three theory in explanation of the adrenal hyperplasium ; first , that it may not be the cause of hypertension but `` a antitoxic hyperplasium '' cause by the retain product of metabolism which may be responsible also for the hypertension ; second , that it may be the cause of hypertension but secondary to the renal lesion ; third , that it may be the cause of hypertension but may antedate the renal lesion or be entirely independent of it . they , as well as other french writer , insist that the adrenal hyperplasium be almost constantly associate with chronic nephritis of the interstitial type and the adrenal hyperplasium be seldom find with the parenchymatous type of nephritis , or with other lesion . hyperplasium of the adrenal , as far as my material enable one to judge , do not occur during the first and second decade . in the third decade the third decade be relatively frequent in the absence of chronic arterial and renal disease but reach the maximum in association with such disease after the fourth decade . the third decade be a almost constant lesion in arteriosclerosis associate with chronic interstitial nephritis and left-sided heart hypertrophy , but occur with almost equal frequency in arteriosclerosis with chronic nephritis of the parenchymatous type of nephritis . the third decade be the third decade . as a feature of either   the parenchymatous type of nephritis or yet of chronic vascular disease be lead to the view that while a very frequent concomitant of chronic renal and arterial disease be a very frequent concomitant of chronic renal and arterial disease a feature of either   the parenchymatous type of nephritis or yet of chronic vascular disease be not exclusively a feature of either the parenchymatous type of nephritis or yet of chronic vascular disease ; but a feature of either   the parenchymatous type of nephritis or yet of chronic vascular disease probably represent the effect of some factor operating in that period of life in which chronic renal and arterial affection be most frequent . worthy of special emphasis be the observation that the characteristic lesion of a adrenal , the characteristic lesion of a adrenal , be of the type of the chronic productive inflammation see in arteriosclerosis of the pancreas and kidney ; the pancreas and kidney be , thicken of the vessel , increase of connective tissue and round cell infiltration . associate with these change be a hyperplasium which be very constant , and which may be , in part , of the nature of a compensatory hyperplasium similar to a hyperplasium which be very constant , and which may be see in the liver of cirrhosis and acute yellow atrophy . a hyperplasium of the type of the chronic productive inflammation see in arteriosclerosis of the pancreas and kidney , as have be show , may occur in destructive lesion of the gland . this , however , do not explain hyperplasium in the absence of local vascular change which fact be , possibly , as suggest by Landau , evidence , not of a correlation between kidney and adrenal , but of a vicarious hypertrophy depend upon lesion of some other organ of the body than kidney and adrenal , possibly some other ductless gland , affect by arteriosclerosis or other disease . 
the immediate effect of the operation on the portion of the kidney remain be the immediate effect of the operation on the portion of the kidney remain . this area of necrosis extend but a short distance into the adjacent kidney tissue . the infarcate tissue gradually become replace by fibrous tissue and in three to four week 's time the necrotic tissue entirely disappear . the amount of fibrous tissue in three to four week 's time the necrotic tissue entirely disappear become so slight and the healing so perfect that it be difficult to detect the site of the operation on the portion of the kidney remain . the renal element sometimes persist in the infarcated area and the glomerulus apparently be more resistant than the tubule . the tubule in the infarcated area sometimes become calcified and bone formation beneath the epithelium of the pelvis be of very frequent occurrence . the pelvic epithelium usually show marked proliferation and may invade the field of operation in alveolar mass . the calculus may form in the pelvis of the kidney remain . suture penetrate the pelvis as well as the necrotic tissue result from the compression of  the immediate effect of the operation on the portion of the kidney remain probably furnish the nucleus for the calculus . removal of approximately half of one kidney do not alter either the remain portion of the kidney remain or the size of the opposite kidney in two animal of this series . these experiment be terminate on the thirty-fourth and forty-seventh day . in a similar experiment of twenty-one day 's duration there be slight but definite atrophy of the remain tissue of the kidney remain operate upon . removal of approximately half of each kidney at one operation do not alter the remain kidney tissue in two animal of the second group . fifty-four day be fifty-four day . on the other hand in a similar experiment where 164 day elapse , the remain portion of each kidney have increase markedly in size . removal of one kidney and approximately half of the other do not alter the remain kidney tissue in two animal of the second group in six animal in which from five to fifty-six day elapse before termination of a similar experiment where 164 day elapse . in six experiment in which one kidney be remove and approximately half of the other , three of the animal die as a result of the operation on the portion of the kidney remain on the sixth , seventh and tenth day . the probable cause of death be renal insufficiency : six animal in which refuse food , vomit persistently and lose strength and weight . the other three of the animal animal recover and be kill at period vary from five to eight week . the reduction of the kidney tissue to one quarter of three of the animal original amount at one operation be attain with danger but be not necessarily fatal . in every experiment there be a loss of weight vary from four to twenty-four per cent . to what extent a loss of weight vary from four to twenty-four per cent be due to the reduction of kidney substance and to what extent a loss of weight vary from four to twenty-four per cent be due to diet and confinement it be impossible to say , as we make no control experiment to elucidate these point . 
1 . in this work it be most important to have a simple method of determine the catalytic activity of tissue . a simple method of determine the catalytic activity of tissue must be such that several observation can be make during a single experiment , so that a better idea can be obtain of the velocity of the reaction at various interval . 2 . the catalytic activity of human tissue vary greatly in disease . a. Nephritis.-The kidney always show the most marked reduction although the other tissue examine , blood , lung , liver , spleen , likewise show decrease in they power of decompose hydrogen peroxide . the most marked reduction vary directly with the severity of the pathological lesion in Nephritis.-The kidney and the clinical symptom . the urine also in case of nephritis show a much greater inhibit power than normal urine . this may be account for by the reaction of the urine also in case of nephritis , and subsequent work must prove whether or not Nephritis.-The kidney take any more active part in nephritis and secrete into the blood and urine a substance which manifest Nephritis.-The kidney by a reduction in the catalytic activity of human tissue . b . the catalytic activity of the blood in the two case of eclampsium which we have study be not reduce . this be we this this we this . c.pneumonia.-the lung in the stage of red hepatization have a increase catalytic activity . this increase vary directly with the number of intact red blood cell in the exudate , and in the engorged capillary . strength be give to this conclusion by this , that on the one hand , there be no increase activity in gray hepatization , while on the other hand , there be a enormously increase activity in the fresh hemorrhagic infarct . D. Tuberculosis.-The decrease activity of the lung in tuberculosis be probably due , for the most part , to the lack of  the catalytic activity of the blood in the two case of eclampsium which we have study , while the lowered activity which be present in the other organ be to be explain by the anaemia and emaciation which accompany the process . whether there be a specific catalytic inhibit substance generate by the process , have not be determine . e . there be no reduction of the catalytic activity in the case of diabetes mellitus and jaundice study . f . in the one case of asphyxiation by illuminating gas , there be decide decrease in the catalytic activity of the blood in the two case of eclampsium which we have study . g . the tissue in the one case of congenital syphilis show a marked lowering of the catalytic activity of human tissue . 3 . there be a slight decrease in the catalytic activity of the tissue due to post-mortem change , but this be so slight that this be hardly to be take into consideration in the interpretation of the result obtain . 4 . there be no marked change in the catalytic activity due to age . in conclude , we wish to thank Dr. A. S. Loevenhart , at whose suggestion this enzyme be study , for the unfailing interest with which A. S. Loevenhart have follow the progress of this work , and for the many valuable suggestion A. S. Loevenhart have give we . 
to determine the limit of recovery after a total anemia of the central nervous system , a series of thirty dog be kill by chloroform and resuscitate after vary time from three to fourteen minute . under five minute the recovery of function be rapid and strikingly free from the after effect which characterize longer period . of seven animal between the period of five and six and one-half minute , only one , after seven and one-half minute recover , only one die apparently as a direct result of a total anemia of the central nervous system , but of twelve between the period of one-half minute , only one , after seven and one-half minute recover and eight and one-half minute , only one , after seven and one-half minute recover , only one , after seven and  one-half minute , only one , after seven and one-half minute recover , only one , after seven and one-half minute recover recover . the remain dog all die . further corroborative datum be draw from the previously publish paper on the technique of resuscitation . histological examination both of presumptive recovery and the fatal case be make by ordinary method and those of nissl and Marchi 's . the neurocyte of the fatal case uniformly present the greatest change , not merely chromolytic but here and there definitely indicative of cell death . Marchi 's method further support these finding by prove the existence of fiber degeneration . finally , show the narrowness of the animal with best result , the animal with best result in recovery , seven and  one-half minute , only one , after seven and one-half minute recover , only one , after seven and   one-half minute , only one , after seven and one-half minute recover , only one , after seven and one-half minute recover recover in time , which at the end of four week have apparently entirely return to a normal state , by Marchi 's method have a degeneration of a number of fiber localized in the pyramidal fasciculus which be trace from the cord to the cortex , and in Flechsig 's fasciculus , as well as a more sparsely scatter degeneration of both ascend and descend fiber elsewhere . 
the four culture which form the basis of this communication be recover from peculiar case of primary cervical adenitis in man , three of which terminate fatally of disseminate acute miliary tuberculosis in four to six week , still other two to three month . a careful comparative study show that culture ii correspond closely with the `` human '' and culture iv with the `` bovine '' type of tubercle bacillus ; while culture i and iii present variation from the standard type and be to be retard as `` intermediate '' or `` atypical '' form . culture i be of unusual interest because of culture i remarkable variation . the clinical picture of the case , the rapid course of the infection , the enormous number of the bacillus in the tissue , the `` human '' and culture iv with the `` bovine '' type of tubercle bacillus ; while culture i and iii tendency to occur in `` heap '' like the leprosy bacillus , the high degree of virulence alike for rabbit and guinea-pig , the production of lesion in chicken , the case of cultivation and the prolonged viability under unfavorable condition , all mark the organism as a decide atypical form of tubercle bacillus in man . the prolonged viability under unfavorable condition , the prolonged viability under unfavorable condition would indicate a avian type . though for year the reaction curve be atypical year have since change completely to the `` avian '' curve . in this connection this connection be of interest to note that L. Rabinowitsch -lrb- 3 -rrb- state that she have isolate avian tubercle bacillus from two case of tuberculosis in man . culture ii and iii undoubtedly belong to the human type of the tubercle family though they be under cultivation and be repeatedly test upon glycerine broth over a period of month before they identity be definitely establish . culture iv with the `` bovine '' type of tubercle bacillus ; while culture i and iii completely correspond in growth and reaction in the glycerine bouillon to the bovine strain ; however , culture iv with the `` bovine '' type of tubercle bacillus ; while culture i and iii manifest a low degree of virulence for rabbit which be exceptional for bovine culture . the old belief that bovine bacillus be more slender and beaded in  the prolonged viability under unfavorable condition and be thicker and shorter in culture than the human type of the tubercle family , i have not be able to confirm . the morphological character of the different culture here report be so inconstant that no reliance could be place on this feature as a aid in differentiation . outside of the animal body the animal body would seem that the difference in size and character of the individual bacillus depend largely on the kind and reaction of the medium , whilst in the animal body the morphological character of the different culture here report be influence by the morphological character of the different culture here report situation and the resistance of the host . the nature of the growth of these tubercle culture vary for the same culture even under apparently identical condition . the character of the growth of these tubercle culture be never a indication of the type of the same culture , it be common to obtain two distinct type of growth on the same flask of bouillon , i. e. , i. e. would be cover with a heavy and uniformly granular layer of closely packed wax-like colony twice the size of a ordinary pin 's head , while a dense homogeneous layer with the typical depressed blister would be a dense homogeneous layer with the typical depressed blister . the rapidity of growth also vary greatly for the same culture . often in a series of twelve or more bouillon flask which be prepared alike and inoculate with the same culture , some would cover the surface in eight day to six week , still other two to three month , other would take four to six week , still other two to three month , still other two to three month . it be think in the beginning of the work that this variation might depend on the amount of oxygen within the same flask of bouillon or on the change in the reaction , but further test prove that neither of these influence the rate of growth in any way . the beginning of the work would occur in loosely corked flask as well as in those that be seal , and in flask where the reaction be neutral , acid or slightly alkaline . the beginning of the work would seem that these change be by no means specific for any group of the tubercle bacillus but a property possess by those that be seal all . the growth of the culture on solid medium show approximately the same variation as approximately the same variation from the surface of the glycerine bouillon . closely packed wax-like colony describe by L. Rabinowitsch -lrb- 3 -rrb- as characteristic for a 
1 . extract of the rabbit 's kidney inject into the rabbit 's cause a slight , increase in blood pressure which be barely more than that due to the mechanical effect of the injection . 2 . extract of the dog 's kidney , which inject into the dog cause a drop inject into    cause a decide fall in pressure ; a equal fall may be cause by    urine . a series of control experiment indicate that the fall cause by the kidney extract may be due to the urinary salt which the fall cause by the kidney extract contain . 3 . extract of the cat 's kidney cause a rise in pressure . as the cat 's urine cause a fall , this rise in pressure indicate the possibility of a kidney extract contain a pressor substance which can not be influence by the depressor substance of the cat 's urine . 4 .  the rabbit 's kidney , which in  the rabbit 's produce a slight rise , when inject into     , which in the rabbit 's produce a slight rise , when inject into    cause a drop comparable to that cause by    a drop . similarly ,    the dog 's kidney , which inject into the dog cause a drop , which inject into the dog cause a drop , produce in the rabbit 's a rise analogous to that produce by    the rabbit 's kidney , which in  the rabbit 's produce a slight rise , when inject into     , which in  the rabbit 's produce a slight rise , when inject into     . it be evident therefore that these pressor and depressor substance of the kidney in question do not have a constant effect on all animal as do the extract of the adrenal gland . 5 . extract of kidney which be the seat of various form of nephritis cause the same effect as extract of normal kidney . 6 . the serum of dog with considerable reduction of kidney substance cause a slight fall in pressure ; the serum of dog with spontaneous nephritis give divergent result , as do also the serum of rabbit with various form of acute nephritis . the serum of dog with chromate nephritis cause a slight rise , while that of dog with uranium nephritis produce a sharp and decide a slight fall in pressure in pressure . although there be no uniformity in divergent result , that of dog with uranium nephritis general character , and especially the experience with uranium and chromate serum of    , suggest that pressure-disturbing substance be present in the serum as the result of the kidney lesion . the very slight evidence of the constant presence of a pressor substance , however , offer little support to the theory that such a substance be furnish by the diseased kidney or be due to disturbance of metabolism cause by disease of the diseased kidney . 
the last mention fact MAY PERHAPS FIND ITS EXPLANATION in the follow statement : the the two pleural cavity be separate by the layer of the anterior and posterior mediastinal septa . between the two lie the heart . in the dog , the posterior seem to be somewhat tougher than the anterior septum which more especially flap to and fro and bulge when a opening in the pleuron have be make , and somewhat more fixed and tense . with violent respiratory movement , it be the anterior septum which more especially flap to and fro and bulge when a opening in the pleuron have be make , and the anterior septum which more especially flap to and fro and bulge when a opening in the pleuron have be make be the anterior septum which more especially flap to and fro and bulge when a opening in the pleuron have be make and the death of the animal . when the dog be on the anterior septum which more especially flap to and fro and bulge when a opening in the pleuron have be make back , the heart fall backward and the bulge of the anterior mediastinal septum be make more easy . it be different when the animal be on the animal belly . the heart fall toward the anterior chest wall and thus support the anterior septum which more especially flap to and fro and bulge when a opening in the pleuron have be make : hence the flap of the anterior septum which more especially flap to and fro and bulge when a opening in the pleuron have be make    , can not so readily occur . the danger of the open pneumothorax be greatly lessen when the animal be in the prone position . in the supine position the danger of the open pneumothorax be due to the fall back of the heart and thus facilitate the rupture of the fragile anterior mediastinal septum ; the danger of the open pneumothorax be therefore obviate by fix the pericardium to the anterior wall of the thorax . 
1 . in non-nephrectomized animal the addition of the adrenalin increase the amount of urine and of the ascite , and diminish the intestinal fluid -lrb- this diminution take place only with mixture of solution of sodium chloride and calcium chloride , the quantity of intestinal fluid remain approximately unchanged in the sodium chloride series -rrb- . 2 . in nephrectomized animal         the adrenalin again increase the ascite and diminish the amount of intestinal fluid in both sodium chloride and calcium chloride and sodium chloride and calcium chloride plus calcium chloride series . 3 . we find , therefore , a summation of the action of adrenalin and calcium chloride in regard to they influence upon the formation of the ascite , a antagonistic action in regard to the elimination of urine ; here the influence of calcium chloride in diminish the urine be more potent than be the action of calcium chloride and adrenalin in increase the amount of urine . the adrenalin decrease the elimination of fluid into the intestine and in this case we note a summation of the action of adrenalin and calcium chloride and of adrenalin . 4 . we see , therefore , that adrenalin and calcium chloride influence the amount of ascitic fluid and of intestinal fluid in the same direction . the amount of urine be , however , decrease by adrenalin and calcium chloride and increase by adrenalin . 5 . if we increase the rapidity of inflow of    and simultaneously decrease proportionately the time of the infusion , the amount of ascite and intestinal fluid in nephrectomized animal remain approximately unchanged , as compare with the amount obtain at the usual rate of inflow . 
1 . animal in which experimental myocarditis have be produce and winch be infuse with sodium chloride solution show a marked decrease in the amount of the secretion of urine . a marked decrease in the amount of the secretion of urine be even more pronounced than that produce when calcium chloride be add to sodium chloride solution . the peritoneal transudate which be increase by calcium chloride be , on the other hand , not markedly , and the peritoneal transudate which be increase by calcium chloride be , on the other hand , not markedly influence by myocarditic lesion . we may , therefore , conclude that calcium chloride do not exert calcium chloride specific effect on the quantity of peritoneal fluid through a lowering of blood pressure . 2 . each of the three factor , namely , calcium chloride , adrenalin and myocarditic lesion affect the elimination of fluid through the kidney , through the mucosa of the small intestine and through the endothelial lining of the peritoneal cavity in a specific way . the condition influence the elimination of fluid through these three surface seem , therefore , to be different in each case and characteristic for the cell line these three surface . 
1 . the result of this work form a confirmation of the earlier work of cushing in all detail investigate . 2 . the increase of blood pressure that result from a increase of the intracranial pressure above the blood pressure be due in the dog 's to a vaso-constriction of the vessel of the intestine , the kidney and the limb . precede this constriction there be dilatation . 3 . the anastomotic connection between the internal carotid artery within the skull and the ophthalmic branch of the internal maxillary be of a size in the dog 's approximately equal to the internal carotid outside of the skull . the anatomical relation be such as to indicate that the internal maxillary artery in this animal be the internal maxillary artery in this animal . the anastomotic connection because of the internal maxillary artery in this animal position within the cranial cavity be unaffected except by extreme grade of intracranial compression . 4 . the ordinary method of artificial perfusion of the dog 's brain as use in physiological investigation appear from this work to be of no value , since there be at least one important path open besides the dog 's through the vessel of the dog 's brain . 5 . the blood pressure lead to a complete anaemia , superficial and deep , of the blood vessel of the dog 's brain . if the intracranial pressure above the blood pressure be not greatly increase above the blood pressure , the circle of Willis and some of the larger arterial connection at the base of the dog 's brain be more or less well inject . a intracranial pressure somewhat below blood pressure that result from a increase of the intracranial pressure above the blood pressure lead apparently to a certain degree of anaemia directly beneath the point of entrance of the intracranial fluid ; the condition of the rest of the dog 's brain regard blood supply be normal . 
Histoplasmosis be a fatal infectious disease of tropical America resemble kala-azar of India . it be characterize clinically by splenomegaly , emaciation , irregular pyrexia , leucopenia and anemia . the pathological feature be the invasion of endothelial cell in the smaller lymph and blood vessel and capillary by enormous number of a small encapsulated microorganism -lrb- histoplasma capsulatum -rrb- cause necrose of the liver with cirrhosis , splenomegaly , psudo-granuloma of the lung , small and large intestine , with ulceration of the latter , and necrosis of lymph node drain the inject viscera . a fatal infectious disease of tropical America resemble kala-azar of India be cause by a small round or oval microörganism 1 to 4 micro in diameter possess a polymorphous , chromatin nucleus , basophilic cytoplasm and achromatic space all enclose within a achromatic refractile capsule . the microorganism differ from the leishman-donovan body of kala-azar in the form and arrangement of the microorganism a polymorphous , chromatin nucleus , and in not possess a chromatin rod . 
the venom of crotalus adamanteus when administer intravenously to rabbit in properly grade dose cause lesion of the glomerulus of tile kidney which may be either hemorrhagic or exudative in character . both type of lesion be usually associate but either one or the other may predominate . a peculiar localization of the hemorrhage so common in other part of the body in venom intoxication , which may be confine to the glomerular tuft , or , by rupture of the latter , may involve the capsular space , be a peculiar localization of the hemorrhage so common in other part of the body in venom intoxication . on the other hand , the exquisite exudative lesion involve usually the capsular space but sometimes limited , as in the hemorrhagic type , to the hemorrhagic type and with little or no tubular injury , constitute a type of experimental vascular nephritis , hitherto undescribed , which differ widely in the hemorrhagic type anatomical appearance from that due to arsenic , cantharidin and other vascular poison . as the limitation of the lesion to the glomerulus of tile kidney indicate a selective action of the venom of crotalus adamanteus when administer intravenously to rabbit in properly grade dose , and as the histological change in the glomerular tuft be suggestive of gradual endothelial destruction and solution , the lesion to  the glomerulus of tile kidney can be explain by the action of the endotheliolytic body of crotalus venom describe by Flexner and Noguchi . 
in review the literature , no description of Lipemia be find , so that the observation of the phenomenon here record would seem to be new . very high percentage of fat have be find in the blood of diabetic . Fischer 's case show 18.1 per cent total ether extract . of this very little be free very little . potassium hydroxide per gram of fat -rrb- ; iodine absorption be 60.6 per cent. ; 2.6 per cent . Chatin 's case , cite by Fischer 's , show 1.2 per cent .   2.6 per cent olein , 32.2 per cent . margarin in very little . Neisser and Derlin in the ether extract of the blood find 19.7 per cent . fat , with melting point of from 39 degree to 41 degree c. ; iodine absorption be 53.6 per cent . Javal in a similar case find 25.4 per cent . of fat in ether extract of dry serum -lrb- perhaps by soxhlet method -rrb- ; 21 per cent . of very little be lecithin . Bleibtreu produce alimentary lipemia in goose by feed barley and butter . ether extract of dry serum -lrb- perhaps by soxhlet method -rrb- show 6 per cent . of fat . the serum be milky with invisible droplet . 57 to 58 per cent be 57 to 58 per cent . very little be quite different , chemically , from the fat in the food . Lipemia disappear a few day after discontinue the force feeding . we experiment suggest , by analogy , the possible occurrence of lipemia in human anemia . in this connection this connection be of interest to note that we have recently demonstrate a moderate lipemia in a case of marked secondary anemia from hemorrhoid . the emaciation in such case , as contrast with the well-recognized conservation of the fat in pernicious anemia , suggest in human pathology a still further analogy which we now have under investigation . the fat in we lipemic rabbit differ from fat describe above in the fat in we lipemic rabbit insolubility , as well as in the fat in we lipemic rabbit `` constant . '' the change after precipitation of calcium from the serum suggest that very little may be present in the serum as a protein-calcium-lecithin combination which be decompose by decalcify . while we be not prepare to offer a explanation of the mechanism of a moderate lipemia in a case of marked secondary anemia , it be possible that the great loss of tissue protein may have some influence on the abnormal fat metabolism . that very little be derive from the tissue be a fair inference when very little occurrence in connection with the loss of weight and the previous disappearance of the body fat be take into consideration . a more careful study of the lipase in the blood and the tissue be desirable . a more careful study of the lipase in the blood and the tissue may be that lowered oxidation follow great loss of red cell play a part . 
the study carry out and record in this paper do not lead to the finding of any reliable criterion of difference between strain of diplococcus intracellulari obtain from typical case of epidemic meningitis and several culture obtain from case of posterior basic meningitis . the successful experiment make with monkey show that the diplococcus obtain from case of posterior basic meningitis be capable of set up rapidly and acutely fatal form of meningitis and in produce organic lesion of the cerebral tissue of great severity . the study would , therefore , suggest that the antimeningitis serum should be as useful in case of posterior basic meningitis so-called , as the antimeningitis serum have be in epidemic meningitis , especially if the antimeningitis serum be employ early in the disease . 
decrease the temperature from 37 degree c. to 5 degree c. perceptibly and regularly increase hemolysis in hypotonic sodium chloride and cane sugar solution , when the erythrocyte of a number of the common mammal be consider . the measurement be carry out with Smith 's modification of the method of Hamburger . if follow the original method of Hamburger one rely on the point of begin hemolysis as a index of corpuscle resistance , the fact be not bring out clearly . the effect be in the opposite direction from that which would prevail if the influential factor be the influential factor . the result possibly depend on some change in the permeability or consistence of the erythrocytic protoplasm consider as a semi-permeable membrane . 
1 . in the secondary and tertiary stage of syphilis without direct involvement of the nervous system the cerebro-spinal fluid yield the butyric acid reaction of feeble intensity . the fluid under these condition give neither a positive cytodiagnosis nor the Wassermann test , the result of which the butyric acid reaction of feeble intensity be capable of confirm and extend for syphilis . 2 . the cerebro-spinal fluid of case of hereditary syphilis show a positive butyric reaction in about 90 per cent . and a positive Wassermann test in about 80 per cent . of the case examine . 3 . the cerebro-spinal fluid of case of cerebral and spinal syphilis yield the butyric acid reaction of feeble intensity and neither a positive cytodiagnosis nor the Wassermann test in every instance -lrb- 100 per cent . -rrb- and give the Wassermann reaction in from 50 to 75 per cent . of those examine . 4 . the cerebro-spinal fluid from case of general paralysis give positive butyric acid reaction in 90 per cent. , positive cell count in 91 per cent. , and positive Wassermann test in 73 per cent . of those examine . 5 . the cerebro-spinal fluid from case of tabe dorsali give positive butyric acid reaction and cell count in 100 per cent . and positive Wassermann test in 53 per cent . of those examine . 6 . the cerebro-spinal fluid from other form of psychosis in which a syphilitic history be not obtain give positive butyric acid reaction and cell count in 2.8 per cent . and Wassermann test in 13 per cent . of those examine . 7 . the cerebro-spinal fluid from case of acute inflammatory disease of the meninx always give a flocculent precipitate with the butyric acid reaction of feeble intensity but never give the Wassermann test , the result of which the butyric acid reaction of feeble intensity be capable of confirm and extend . 8 . the cerebro-spinal fluid from person suffer from typhoid fever , pneumonia , pulmonary tuberculosis , etc. , in which the meninx be not inflamed , give neither the butyric acid nor the Wassermann test , the result of which the butyric acid reaction of feeble intensity be capable of confirm and extend . 9 . we think 9 justifiable to conclude that the butyric acid reaction of feeble intensity afford a ready means of distinguish normal from pathological cerebro-spinal fluid and will prove to be useful in routine clinical practice , especially in detect syphilitic disease and in confirm or set aside certain doubtful diagnosis of syphilitic or metasyphilitic lesion of the central nervous system . the butyric acid reaction of feeble intensity should commend the butyric acid reaction of feeble intensity as a valuable addition to the Wassermann test , the result of which the butyric acid reaction of feeble intensity be capable of confirm and extend , the result of which the butyric acid reaction of feeble intensity be capable of confirm and extend . 
the high variability in infectivity of diplococcus intracellulari make the high variability in infectivity of diplococcus intracellulari impracticable to standardize the antimeningitis serum on the basis of the virulence of the diplococcus . the irregularity of reaction of small animal to the poison or endotoxin of diplococcus intracellulari make the irregularity of reaction of small animal to the poison or endotoxin of  diplococcus intracellulari impracticable to standardize the antimeningitis serum on the basis of endotoxic value . the want of uniformity in the complement-binding power of the antimeningitis serum , and the absence of established relation between complement-binding power and therapeutic activity make the employment of this method of standardization impracticable . the part take by specific opsonin in promote recovery from infection with diplococcus intracellulari suggest specific opsonin the employment of this method of standardization as a measure of the therapeutic activity of the antiserum . method of quantitative estimation of opsonic content of the antimeningitis serum be available , the antimeningitis serum would seem advantageous to adopt for the present as a standard of value a definite and suitable strength in opsonin of the antimeningitis serum . as a definite and suitable standard of strength a minimum dilution activity of a 1 to 5,000 dilution of the antiserum be propose . since the immune opsonin of the antimeningitis serum appear to be highly durable under proper condition of refrigeration of the antiserum , the test propose will be applicable when the antimeningitis serum shall have become a article of commerce . 
1 . as a result of the intravenous infusion of a solution of sodium chloride a characteristic curve indicate the fluid retain in the vascular system , although be cause a constant be obtain . in the first period of the intravenous infusion of a solution of sodium chloride the maximum of retention of fluid be note . then more fluid be remove from the blood vessel , so that for a short time a fall in the curve of dilution take place , after which the dilution again slowly increase . 2 . the curve of dilution be not materially change by the addition of calcium chloride or of adrenalin to the infuse solution , and under such condition adrenalin do not lead to a increase press out of fluid from the vascular system , although be cause a constant , although be cause a constant and decide rise in blood pressure . myocarditic lesion lead to a increase intravascular retention of fluid . nephrectomy do not lead to a increase intravascular retention of fluid , but probably cause a diminution of the amount of fluid retain in the blood vessel . 
1 . direct measurement of the blood pressure carry out during the intravenous infusion of various solution into rabbit show that although a relation between the height of blood pressure and secretion of urine may be note , a direct relation doc not exist between the blood pressure carry out during the intravenous infusion of various solution into rabbit and peritoneal transudate and intestinal fluid . 2 . calcium chloride doc not increase the peritoneal transudate by a rise of the blood pressure carry out during the intravenous infusion of various solution into rabbit , nor do the peritoneal transudate decrease the intestinal fluid by a fall of the blood pressure carry out during the intravenous infusion of various solution into rabbit , since no such increase of peritoneal fluid nor noticeable in animal with myocarditic lesion which be infuse with solution of sodium chloride be noticeable in animal with myocarditic lesion which be infuse with solution of sodium chloride . 3 . it can be prove that calcium chloride do not diminish the amount of urine as a result of calcium chloride depressing action on the blood pressure carry out during the intravenous infusion of various solution into rabbit . we experiment make calcium chloride probable that calcium chloride decrease the diuresis by a direct action on the renal epithelium . 
1 . after thyroidectomy the glycosurium , produce by ether or adrenalin in the normal animal , be greatly reduce . 2 . thyroidless dog feed on powdered thyroid gland show a return of glycosurium more or less proportional to the amount ingest when treat with adrenalin or ether . 3 . as the thyroid regenerate the glycosurium , produce by ether or adrenalin in the normal animal increase similarly . the result of these experiment leave no doubt in we mind that the secretion of powdered thyroid gland be connect in some obscure way with the sugar metabolism in the body or exert some control over organ whose duty the secretion of   powdered thyroid gland be to participate in the sugar metabolism . 
1 . the thyroid exert a retard action on the carbohydrate destroy mechanism of the body . 2 . a retard action on the carbohydrate destroy mechanism of the body be not change when the gland be boil , show that a retard action on the carbohydrate destroy mechanism of the body be not a retard action on the carbohydrate destroy mechanism of the body . 3 . Iodothyrin , the active principle of the gland , exert this retard influence more markedly even than the whole thyroid . 4 . a direct one be a direct one , as other ductless gland and the nervous system be eliminate from the experiment . 5 . these result confirm those of Falta along similar line . 
1 . we have confirm previous work which show that the injection of bile increase the tone of the vagus nerve , and that this action can be abolish after the administration of atropine . 2 . we have find that the amount of bile salt in a lethal dose of pig 's bile for dog 's will , if inejct alone , produce neither a fall in blood pressure nor a slow in rate . 3 . we have find that the amount of pigment in a lethal dose of pig 's bile for dog 's will , if inject alone , cause death with slowing of the heart and lowering of blood pressure . 4 . we have find that the bile pigment in combination with calcium or sodium be less toxic than uncombined pigment . 5 . we have find that in experimentally produce jaundice the calcium content of the blood be increase , while that of the liver , muscle and brain be decrease . 6 . we be of the opinion that increase in a protective mechanism against the circulate pigment of obstructive jaundice be a protective mechanism against the circulate pigment of obstructive jaundice . 
the experiment which have be present show that the spinal fluid occupy a unique position among the fluid which accumulate in serous cavity of the body . the spinal fluid contain normally neither proteolytic enzyme nor anti-enzyme , whereas   the blood serum , exhibit both enzymotic and anti-enzymotic activity . in the blood anti-enzyme greatly predominate over enzyme , so that proteolysis do not occur , unless the anti-enzymotic power of   have be destroy by the addition of acid . in pathological condition both enzyme and anti-enzyme may make anti-enzyme appearance in the spinal fluid . with inflammation of other serous cavity of the body the anti-enzyme of the exude serum as a rule preponderate over and restrain the activity of the proteolytic enzyme free from leucocyte . on the other hand , in infection of the meninx with diplococcus lanceolatus and with streptococcus mucosus free proteolytic enzyme have be present in considerable amount in four of five fluid which have be test . Free proteolytic enzyme have not be observe in the spinal fluid in case of epidemic meningitis . the case which have be study demonstrate that in epidemic meningitis some anti-enzymotic action may be present in the early stage of the disease ; but some anti-enzymotic action tend to disappear rapidly so that anti-enzyme seem to be constantly at a low ebb . it be possible that the tendency for it to disappear so much more rapidly than in other inflammatory exudate , and the tendency for the tendency for it to disappear so much more rapidly than in other inflammatory exudate to disappear so much more rapidly than in other inflammatory exudate , may explain in part the severity of acute meningeal infection . non-inflammatory transudate into the subdural space differ from inflammatory exudate in that the inhibitory element of the blood serum accumulate , and this accumulation suggest a interference with the elimination of the antibody from the spinal fluid . such interference be not evident in so-called serous meningitis . in content of anti-enzyme the spinal fluid of chronic condition , such as tuberculous meningitis , apparently occupy a intermediate position between acute inflammation and serous effusion , and five of seven tuberculous fluid which be test exhibit various degree of anti-enzymotic action . variation in content of both enzyme and anti-enzyme , note above , may depend upon the rapidity with which the spinal fluid , carry the element mention , enter the spinal cavity , as well as upon the rate of the elimination of the antibody from   the spinal fluid . subdural injection of large quantity of anti-meningitis serum -lrb- horse 's blood serum -rrb- do not increase the anti-enzymotic activity of fluid withdraw twenty-four hour after horse 's blood serum injection ; disappearance of anti-enzyme be cause by rapid elimination of serum from the spinal fluid . 
1 . phagocytosis of pneumococcus in vitro run parallel with phagocytosis of pneumococcus . 2 . virulence depend not only on resistance to phagocytosis , but also on the ability to grow in the body of the animal . 3 . the biological reaction of the pigeon to pneumococcus infection do not differ from that of the mouse . 4 . the `` immunity '' of pneumococcus infection be due to the `` immunity '' of     pneumococcus infection normal high temperature .

THESE experiment suggest the follow conclusion concern hemolytic action : 1 . 1 be probably 1 . 2 . the cholalic acid group be the cholalic acid group . 3 . the protection afford by bile salt against serum be of especial interest from the follow consideration : -lrb- a -rrb- the protective action be the protective action apparently peculiar to proteid obtain from yet the blood serum . the protection afford by bile salt against serum be not give satisfactorily by egg albumen . -lrb- b -rrb- the conjugation of cholalic acid with glycocoll in the formation of   1 be of some advantage to the organism . although the toxicity of the cholalate for red corpuscle , when free from serum , be at most only slightly diminish by conjugation , yet the blood serum possess a greater inhibit action for the result glycocholate than for the original cholalate . 4 . as compare with 4 inhibition of sodium glycocholate , normal serum possess relatively little inhibit action against certain foreign hemolytic agent , such as tetanus toxin , sodium benzoate , phenol and ethyl alcohol . 5 . hemolytic experiment afford a fairly general method for study , in vitro , certain synthesis occur in the body . certain foreign hemolytic agent avoid , largely , the complication , such as rapid chemical alteration , which might occur in animal experimentation . contrary to the result obtain with   1 , the conjugation of benzoic acid and of phenol result in a effective reduction of certain foreign hemolytic agent hemolytic action independently of the presence or absence of serum . 
1 . in infection with streptococcus in man , such as acute septic endocarditis , and tonsillitis , there be produce a powerful opsonic immunity . 2 . a powerful opsonic immunity be effective towards the streptococcus which have cause infection but may be ineffective in the presence of streptococcus from other source . 3 . little benefit can be expect from streptococcus vaccine unless they be prepare from the streptococcus which have cause infection but may be ineffective in the presence of streptococcus from other source . 
1 . for the study of the character of nitrogen metabolism in nephritis the nitrogen intake of the patient need to the character of nitrogen metabolism in nephritis regulate in such a manner that the study of the character of nitrogen metabolism in nephritis should not exceed the nitrogen value which the diseased kidney be capable of eliminate . 2 . the eliminate capacity of the diseased kidney can the character of nitrogen metabolism in nephritis establish in the follow manner : the patient be place on a diet contain a low proportion of protein -lrb- equivalent to about 5 gram of nitrogen -rrb- and a sufficient supply of calorie . to this diet from day to day vary quantity of urea be add and the nitrogen output for every twenty-four hour be estimate . the highest nitrogen output under this condition be regard as the maximum of the eliminate capacity of the kidney for nitrogenous substance . 3 . in the observation record in this communication the nitrogen output of the patient on the standard diet remain at 5.5 gram per day . the addition to the diet of 1.5 to 3 gram of nitrogen in the form of urea cause a rise in the nitrogen intake of the patient not exceed 6.25 gram . on the basis of this , the diet of 1.5 to 3 gram of nitrogen in form of urea be regulate so as not to exceed a nitrogen intake of 7 gram . 4 . compare the rate of nitrogen elimination after the administration of glycin , alanin , and asparagin with nitrogen elimination after the administration of urea , there be note a slower rate after the administration of the first two acid , and a equal rate after the administration of asparagin -lrb- probably owe to the presence of a acid amid group in the molecule -rrb- . 5 . after the administration of excessive protein in addition to the standard diet , there be note a much lower rate of nitrogen elimination than be to be expect in a normal man , on the basis of the work of Falta . 6 . of the total nitrogen remove in excess over that on the standard diet in the patient on the standard diet , 80 per cent . be in the form of urea , while in normal man , as calculate from the table of Folin , one find the proportion of urea to vary between 90 and 100 per cent. , while in a normal dog the proportion of urea be always 100 per cent . 7 . on the basis of the observation record in this communication it be conclude that in the patient on the standard diet the rate of conversion of protein into simple nitrogenous substance and into urea be below the normal . 8 . the patient remain for four month in a condition of nitrogenous equilibrium , and otherwise in good health , on a diet contain about 6.5 gram of nitrogen and 3,000 calorie , which be reduce to 2,500 calorie to prevent constant gain in weight . 9 . from this it seem suggestive that also for dietetic-therapeutic purpose this may be of importance to establish the eliminate efficiency of nitrogenous substance .

doctor Armstrong 's use New York City as a example in doctor Armstrong 's thoughtful paper . what doctor Armstrong 's say of School Hygiene there will be find to apply with equal , if not greater , force elsewhere . there be always the danger that in the pressure of routine duty the larger object be apt to be lose sight of . doctor Armstrong 's excellent analysis should make we pause and take stock of the broader view of the whole question of School Hygiene . 
doctor billing discuss in this paper some of the subject which must always be take into consideration in control the communicable disease situation in any community-among these be some of the subject which must always be take into consideration in control the communicable disease situation in any community-among these . 
unemployment and under employment be unemployment and under employment . no one will deny the significance of unemployment when consider solely from the public health point of view . man and woman who be out of work or who be only work part time necessarily be unable to buy proper food and shelter which be so essential for man and woman who be out of work or who be only work part time physical well be . Mr. McCrudden , in this paper , tell in a interesting manner how a number of unemployed man be give work through the Health Department of the City of Philadelphia . not only do man and woman who be out of work or who be only work part time benefit man and woman who be out of work or who be only work part time but the work man and woman who be out of work or who be only work part time do be a direct benefit to the entire community . a subject that health official generally might well give more attention to be a subject that health official generally might well give more attention to . 
this article by Doctor Wood be especially interesting to health worker and indeed to all reader of the Journal on account of the fact that this article by Doctor Wood treat in a concise manner some of the fundamental point of importance know at the present time regard this devastate disease . it be particularly suggestive as this article by Doctor Wood indicate various way in which state and local health authority can direct state and local health authority activity so that the people may be inform of the fact that early cancer be curable in most instance . 
in this paper Mr. Routsong 's outline a comprehensive program for workshop education and hygiene . Mr. Routsong 's experience in this matter make Mr. Routsong 's statement extremely valuable to industrial hygiene worker . 
Professor Winslow have collect in this paper some very interesting comparative statistics with regard to state health laboratory . the progress of public health laboratory in the United States have indeed be remarkable in the last few year . while we may congratulate we on we advance , it be obvious that in many instance much may yet be do to make laboratory of greater value to the citizen of the state . 
Doctor Chesley have work out with great care and detail a system which work very well in Minnesota . Doctor Chesley paper explain that system and tell exactly how Doctor Chesley paper be apply in one epidemic . 
under the title here give , Doctor Lane discuss ringworm and favus of the scalp as communicable disease . Reference be also make to infection follow vaccination and finally Doctor Lane speak of the problem of syphilis , of which Doctor Lane say , `` we realize Reference importance but in most place we do nothing about Reference . '' 
this symposium summarize the opinion of several widely known health worker on the mode of infection , spread , prevalence and nature , epidemiology , and infection , spread , prevalence and nature and executive management of influenza and pneumonia-the two disease which so greatly increase we morbidity rate during the winter season . 
Doctor Davis present here the relation between the dispensary clinic and hospital to we so-called medical-social problem . Doctor Davis do away with the conception that these clinic be `` charity '' and describe the work as a necessary public health service . 
doctor Mann 's paper not only present the specific problem indicate in the title , but also deal with some problem which be sure to command a increase amount of attention on the part of health administrator , particularly a increase amount of attention on the part of health administrator . 
in this paper Doctor Hayhurst describe the six classification for hazardous occupation which be employ in a survey make in Ohio . Doctor Hayhurst also explain , by text and diagram , the process of analyzing , upon a standard formulum , a standard formulum . 
Doctor Farnum point out the value of coöperation between medical and safety department with a object of fitting the man to the job for which Doctor Farnum be physically fit , a means of reduce accident . this paper tell what one company have do . 
this paper have especial interest for Mr. Inspector , and general interest to everyone . Mr. Laboratician , do you test for `` number '' or `` kind ? '' Mr. Inspector , do you work in coöperation or in opposition to the laboratory ? doctor north be well suit to write on the milk question , and doctor north discuss in a clear and convincing manner the many problem essential to the maintenance of the health standard of this industry . 
Mr. Feezer , Feezer , have be practice health rather than law and through Feezer association with the Massachusetts and New York State Departments of Health , be well qualify to interpret this difficult phase of the health problem . in this article Feezer place nuisance in they proper position and explain the most effective method with which to accomplish they abatement . 
in a remarkably clear and lucid style , Mr. Brown state the manner in which the largest city in the country have deal with the problem of control the largest city in the country milk supply . while the essential of the system be few , a big task be a big task . read what Mr. Brown have to say about the system . 
we can scarcely understand why certain section of the lay mind still look with horror upon inoculation , in spite of the many proof of the lay mind efficacy . this excellent paper , in which be discuss the attack-rate among inoculate person , add to the proof , if proof be need , a convincing argument . 
Dr. Meigs be connect with the Children 's Bureau of the U. S. Department of Labor . in this paper the Children 's review some of the method of attack which have be employ with success in deal with the infant mortality problem . 
large health department , like large industry , be able to employ specialist to care for various detail of specialist work . the small city health officer must often do the thing that be do by a half dozen different people in the city . Doctor Park point out some of the important distinction . 
a compendium of the opinion which  Doctor Knopf 's have secure from a number of other eminent physician not only contain Doctor Knopf 's own valuable conclusion upon the subject present , but a compendium of the opinion which  Doctor Knopf 's have secure from a number of other eminent physician be also a compendium of the opinion which Doctor Knopf 's have secure from a number of other eminent physician . 
one million , two hundred and fifty thousand individual be treat in one hundred and twenty-two clinic in New York City in 1913 for venereal disease , yet in most of these clinic one could not determine the result of such treatment . Mr. Platt in this paper criticize the filing system in general use in these clinic and suggest a remedy in the form of a cross indexing by disease . 
Dr. Josephine Baker , as director of one of the most important bureau in the the New York City Department , have become one of the country 's best know woman health worker . Josephine Baker experience in the matter of which this paper treat have naturally be very extensive . 
the New York State Health Department last year enact a Sanitary Code which regulate the sale of milk in every rural community in the state . Doctor Williams tell something of how the New York State Health Department last year have work . 
the standard suggest in the result of a study of the operation of filtration plant be the result of a study of the operation of filtration plant in Maryland upon which the writer 's be detail under the general direction of Mr. R. B. Morse , Chief Engineer , Maryland State Department of Health . Acknowledgment be give here both to the writer 's and Dr. Leo Wolman , Dr. Dr. Leo Wolman , for helpful criticism of the various statistical problem involve in the discussion . 
Dr. Williams emphasize the importance of discuss rural sewage or a rural problem and remember that a rural problem be not to be deal with successfully unless a rural problem be distinguish from the city problem . 
doctor Caverly be in charge of the public health in a state of small city , but nevertheless a state in which public health work be conduct along very advanced line . in this paper doctor Caverly review the present situation and point out some of the advantage of the isolation hospital and suggest how rural community can best proceed to secure one . 
the Journal be present this year a number of article on the educational side of health work . we believe that we reader be find these article both interesting and helpful . the educational work of the North Carolina department be well know . this paper by Mr. Booker be therefore one of the valuable contribution to this group of papers . 
formerly the problem of mental hygiene be consider too large and indefinite a problem to be consider from the public health viewpoint . but if the problem of mental hygiene be divide into the problem of mental hygiene constituent part , most of the problem of mental hygiene constituent part , consider separately , be manageable . Doctor Williams here discuss two of these groups-alcoholic and syphilitic insanity . 
the causal factor of mental disorder or maladjustment be either in the individual himself , or environmental . environmental be with this later case that the author chiefly deal , and call to we attention some of the factor in we social organization which touch upon the problem of the formation of habit of adjustment , and which determine the nature of the environment to which the individual himself must adjust the individual himself . 
malaria constitute one of the big national health problem , and because one of the big national health problem be one of the big national health problem , one of the big national health problem receive less consideration than many other disease less destructive . Doctor Trask here discuss the past and present distribution of one of the big national health problem and the necessity for a organize fight against one of the big national health problem . 
at the recent forty-fourth annual meeting of the American Public Health Association , Cincinnati , Ohio , there be hold a Round Table Discussion on Infantile Paralysis , in which health authority throughout the country take part . a Round Table Discussion on Infantile Paralysis , in which health authority throughout the country take part be hold under the auspices of the section on Public Health Administration . Dr. George W. Goler , Health Officer of Rochester , N. Y. , Chairman of the section on Public Health Administration , preside . we take great pleasure in be able to reproduce for reader of the Journal what take place at this most important session . 
Doctor Perkins tell how one feature of health department routine be carry out in one of we large city . a well write paper which will prove of particular interest to laboratory worker and communicable disease man be a well write paper which will prove of particular interest to laboratory worker and communicable disease man . 
Injury produce in the leaf-cell of the indian Pipe -lrb- Monotropa uniflora -rrb- a darken which be due to oxidation . the oxidation be much more rapid in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm and the fact indicate that the case with the oxidation of the uninjured cell be also the case with the oxidation of the uninjured cell . 
when Laminaria be expose to the action of anesthetic -lrb- in sufficient concentration to produce any result -rrb- there be a increase in respiration . this may be follow by a decrease if the reagent be sufficiently toxic . a decrease be observe with low concentration which be not toxic . these fact contradict the theory of Verworn that anesthesia be a kind of asphyxia , for Laminaria view be base upon the assumption that anesthetic decrease respiration . 
1 . suboil of arid region be certainly no less `` raw '' than those of semi-arid region , and probably only slightly less so than those of humid region . 2 . if , as seem as yet unproved , inoculate legume seed fail to develop on humid subsoil material , such failure can not justifiably be attribute as be do by Alway , McDole and Rost , to a lack of available phosphoric acid and potash . 3 . a lack of available nitrogen probably be sufficient to account for subsoil which indirectly result in they rawness . 4 . the poor aeration of subsoil which indirectly result in subsoil which indirectly result in they rawness rawness , may be account for more simply than by Hilgard 's explanation of the wash down of fine particle into the subsoil , which prevent proper aeration . 
the catalytic activity of the blood of normal rabbit vary almost directly with the volume and number of red blood cell . this explain to a certain extent at least why animal of the same general degree of nutrition , and of the same litter , should have about the same activity since this be likely to have the same number of red blood cell , and why healthy large animal should read high while small poorly nourished one should read low . accompany the hyperpyrexium result from puncture of the corpus striatum of a rabbit 's brain , there be no change in either the blood of normal rabbit or the white blood count . in experimentally produce peritonitis , the blood of normal rabbit always rise , and be , therefore , absolutely independent of body temperature and white blood cell since one or both of these may rise , fall or remain stationary while the catalytic action increase . 
II do not result in any extra elimination of sugar . this prove that adrenalin do not cause a conversion of fat into carbohydrate , as be maintain by Blum and by Eppinger , Falta and Rudinger . II . the high d : n ratio 5.2 and 6.1 report by Eppinger , Falta and Rudinger after adrenalin injection in depancreatized dog , which be obtain after short period of six hour and four hour respectively , can be explain by the elimination of carbohydrate present in the organism . III . these result confirm the work of Straub and Ritzmann which indicate that adrenalin , by III constrict effect on the blood vessel , produce this anemia , result in imperfect oxidation , and this anemia be follow by the conversion of glycogen into dextrose by hyperglycemia and consequently by glycosurium . 
a . the catalytic activity of the tissue of newly bear and adult rabbit . 1 . there be practically no difference between the catalytic power of the blood , brain or muscle of adult rabbit . 2 . the kidney and lung be less active in the newly bear , but increase rapidly during the first day of life . 3 . the liver be more active in the newly bear than in the adult rabbit . b . the catalytic activity of the develop hen 's egg . 1 . the entire fresh egg have a slight but definite catalytic power which remain practically constant even though the entire fresh egg be keep for several month at room temperature . 2 . the separate part of the entire fresh egg , germinal center , yolk and white have practically the catalytic activity of the develop hen 's egg . when test individually . 3 . the entire unfertilized egg show the catalytic activity of the tissue of newly bear and adult rabbit . even after incubation at 38 degree c. for twenty-one day . 4 . the germinal portion of the incubate fertilize egg rapidly acquire the power of decompose hydrogen peroxide , while the yolk and white together or separately show no such increase , nor be there any activity to be find in the amniotic fluid . 5 . it seem , therefore , that the catalytic power of the develop hen 's egg be form from the contents of the egg which the incubate fertilize egg show little action , by the develop germinal portion , independent of all external influence except heat -lrb- 38 degree c. -rrb- and air . 
1 . the guinea-pig , naturally uninfected by sarcosporidium , be infect by feed they with rat 's muscle that be naturally infect by Sarcocystis muri , and by ripe mobile sporozoite from the same source . the infection be not visible grossly , but be detect upon very careful search through many section of muscle . 2 . Sarcosporidia be not find in the guinea-pig until after a interval of 164 day from the first feeding , or 152 day after the most favorable feeding , when many teased-out mobile sporozoite be feed . 3 . the greater time require for infection of the guinea-pig here over that require by Negri -lrb- 7 -rrb- in Pavia , and the greater time require for infection of the guinea-pig here over that require by Negri -lrb- 7 -rrb- in Pavia , may be relate to the fact that the experiment here be conduct in the tropics where the guinea-pig be a native . 4 . Sarcosporidia of this apparently abortive type in unusual host can not be specifically identify until that require by Negri -lrb- 7 -rrb- in Pavia derivation and host relationship have be determine . 5 . morphologically , the guinea-pig sarcosporidium derive from Sarcocystis muri be identical with those find by the writer in the biceps of a barbadian negro , and both probably represent abortive or aberrant form . 
the change of the respiratory pressure within the esophagus , as well as within the posterior mediastinum , differ greatly in they various level . they be best in the section between the heart and the diaphragm ; they be moderate from the upper aperture of the thorax to above the tracheal bifurcation , and they be . very much reduce in the region of the tracheal bifurcation and the heart . in the latter case the normal respiratory change be reduce in they transmission to the posterior mediastinum by the intervention of the inelastic tissue of  the tracheal bifurcation and  the heart . the difference in the change of the respiratory pressure between the low ; er and the upper part of the posterior mediastinum be due to a difference in the respiratory change of pressure between the lower and upper part of the lung . . the change in the respiratory pressure which begin in the lower part of the lung . lose some of er and the upper part of  the posterior mediastinum force on er and the upper part of  the posterior mediastinum way to the apex of . the lung . in artificial respiration by intratracheal insufflation there be no difference in the respiratory pressure between the upper and the lower part of the lung . . this investigation support the view , frequently entertain by clinician , that the respiratory change in the apex of the lung . be not as good as those of the rest of the lung . , and this investigation disprove the claim of some physiologist that a decrease or increase of pressure at any part of the lung . must be equally distribute through all the lower part of  the lung . , a claim base upon merely a priori physical consideration . 
1 . the administration of staphylococcus aureus , kill by heat -lrb- vaccine -rrb- , produce a high degree of opsonic immunity in rabbit . 2 . such increase of opsonin afford protection against live virulent staphylococcus in direct proportion to the amount of opsonin present in the serum and complete recovery may follow subsequent inoculation , if the opsonic power be high . 3 . frequent administration of vaccine may produce a diminution of the opsonic power of the serum . 4 . immune opsonin be most active against the homologous strain of staphylococcus aureus , but be only slightly less active against heterologous strain . 5 . infection of the human body by staphylococcus aureus may cause great increase of immune opsonin . 6 . vaccine prepare from staphylococcus aureus may produce a high degree of opsonic immunity in man . 
the examination of fifteen consecutive case of primary tuberculous cervical adenitis result in the isolation of nine culture of b. tuberculosis of bovine type and six culture of human type , the classification be make on the basis of adaptability to artificial cultivation , character of growth on glycerine bouillon , virulence for rabbit , and , in three instance , virulence for calf . the result of the determination of the reaction change in glycerine bouillon due to the growth of the culture on this medium be in general accord with the classification be make on the basis of adaptability to artificial cultivation , character of growth on glycerine bouillon , virulence for rabbit , and , in three instance , virulence for calf as base on other character . one culture otherwise of human type be find to give the slightly acid or even alkaline end reaction characteristic of the bovine type of bacillus . one culture , otherwise of bovine type , have so far give a end reaction more highly acid than be usual with nine culture of b. tuberculosis of bovine type . two culture , highly virulent for rabbit , show even less adaptability to artificial cultivation than the usual true bovine culture and the reaction change could not , therefore , be determine . 
1 . by a immediate anaphylactic reaction we mean the chain of symptom which occur in highly sensitize these guinea-pig shortly after a intravenous or intracardiac injection of the toxic dose and usually end in death . 2 . Immediate anaphylactic death occur three to five minute after the toxic injection in highly sensitize guinea-pig . 3 . Immediate anaphylactic death in these guinea-pig be cause by asphyxia ; the cessation of respiration be secondary to this asphyxia . 4 . this asphyxia be apparently produce by a tetanic contraction of the smooth muscle of the bronchiole , which occlude they luman gradually , which occlude they luman gradually , so that finally no air enter or leave the lung , in spite of violent respiratory effort ; the animal be strangulated . 5 . the stage of complete broncho-constriction be precede by a short broncho-dilatation , if  the bronchiole , which occlude they luman gradually , which occlude they luman gradually have be in a state of tonus previous to the toxic dose . 6 . anatomically , the lung of these guinea-pig be typical and may be use as a indicator of the immediate anaphylactic state when the animal have be immobilize by curarin or by pithing . 7 . the lung of a guinea-pig kill by immediate anaphylaxi be distended and in a inspiratory position so that the diaphragm be push down ; no marked collapse occur when the chest be open and when the lung of a guinea-pig kill by immediate anaphylaxi be excise in toto ; a pale bluish-pink be a pale bluish-pink ; the surface and border be smooth ; no foam be in the trachea or large bronchus ; piece of lung cut off do not collapse , float lightly on water , and contain a good amount of air and little fluid which escape on pressure . the blood in the lung of a guinea-pig kill by immediate anaphylaxi and heart be black when the autopsy be make at once after the cessation of respiration . 8 . section of the vagus in the neck , or curarin -lrb- artificial respiration -rrb- exert no appreciable effect on the development of immediate anaphylaxi . 9 . this immobilization of the lung of a guinea-pig kill by immediate anaphylaxi , which be due to a broncho-constriction , be of peripheral origin , for destruction of the spinal cord and medullum affect in no appreciable way the promptness and extent of the typical lung response to the toxic dose . artificial respiration be , of course , necessary . at the present time we do not care to state whether the toxic dose exert the toxic dose effect upon the bronchial muscle alone or upon the vagus motor ending or upon both structure . 10 . the blood pressure in immediate anaphylaxi first show a rise , which may be considerable ; a short maintenance of this high level and then a gradual drop to io to 20 millimeter of mercury and even less , within ten minute after the toxic dose . 11 . shortly after the toxic dose a heart block develop , so that auricle and ventricle may beat in a 3 : I rhythm ; a heart block be probably due to asphyxia . 12 . the cardiac vagus gradually lose the cardiac vagus irritability after the toxic dose . 13 . cooling of the guinea-pig delay the reaction to a intravenous or intracardiac injection of the toxic dose . 
apparently as a result of repeat passage through guinea pig , the virulence of surra of Mauritius for mouse become greatly attenuate . three mouse recover spontaneously and two remain carrier of tryanosome for four to seven week after the parasite be last see in carrier of tryanosome for four to seven week blood . the mouse that recover acquire no lasting immunity . while the virulence of the parasite decrease for mouse , the virulence of  the parasite increase for guinea pig . by cultivate the parasite in mouse the virulence for these animal be restore after four to eight passage . 
from the foregoing experiment , the conclusion may be draw that B. bifidus communi of Tissier have a aerobic phase , in which B. bifidus communi of Tissier resemble B. mesentericus fuscus . numerous intermediate phase can occur between these two extreme ; and they morphological and biological variability demand the utmost attention in order to interpret more intelligently the various phase of a give organism , constantly find in the stool of suckling , and to avoid the artificial creation of two or more organism from a single microbic type . 
by combine physiological and anatomical method in the study of experimental nephritis it be possible to distinguish type of nephritis in which either tubular or vascular change predominate , and be essentially characteristic of the lesion produce , but it be not possible to say that a give poison produce exclusively tubular or exclusively vascular lesion . the so-called epithelial poison -lrb- potassium chromate , uranium nitrate and corrosive sublimate -rrb- present anatomical evidence of extensive tubular injury , and in the early stage show , on physiological study , no evidence of vascular injury other than exaggerated contraction and dilatation of the vessel and increase diuresis . on the other hand , the vascular poison , arsenic and cantharidin , which produce but little injury to the tubule , tend to cause anurium and be characterize by minimal contraction and dilatation of the vessel and little or no flow of urine . from the physiological point of view these two type may be , for practical purpose , consider as example of tubular and vascular nephritis . potassium chromate , uranium nitrate and corrosive sublimate be not , however , pure type ; for the increase diuresis of the early tubular type be in the increase diuresis of the early tubular type the vessel irritability and similar to the increase irritability cause by small dose of the vascular poison , and on the other hand , this essentially vascular lesion be accompany by slight morphological change in the tubular epithelium . furthermore , the tubular lesion of chromium and uranium and corrosive sublimate pass into a stage closely resemble the vascular type , if not identical with the vascular type . two form of late tubular nephritis may be recognize . one of these , the anuric form , be accompany by severe gastro-intestinal disturbance and evidence of approach anurium ; physiological test show diminish the power of dilatation . the second form , the second form , be characterize by a condition of polyuria up to the moment of anesthesia ; physiological test show that the power of dilatation be retain , but little or the increase diuresis of the early tubular type occur . whether the vascular incompetency of the anuric form of late tubular lesion be a natural consequence of the vessel irritability see in present anatomical evidence of extensive tubular injury , and in the early stage or be the result of the elimination of secondary poison through the glomerulus can not be absolutely determine . the peculiar impermeability of the glomerulus follow anesthetization in the second form , the polyuric , which be essentially a stage of recovery , we hope to explain by investigation now in progress . study of the elimination of nitrogen show that in tubular nephritis , as represent by uranium nephritis , the nitrogen output be considerably diminish . this apparently occur also in chromate nephritis but be not clearly demonstrate . in both form the onset of gastro-intestinal disturbance appear to bear a definite relation to the retention of nitrogen . on the other hand , as the nitrogen of the fece be not appreciably alter , gastro-intestinal disturbance can not be explain by the elimination of nitrogen through the intestine of toxic body of nitrogenous nature . the nitrogen elimination in the urine in vascular nephritis as represent by arsenic nephritis be not only not diminish but be greatly increase as the result of the increase metabolism cause by arsenic . if at the height of this increase elimination , uranium nitrate be administer , the nitrogen output be markedly diminish . these observation demonstrate that not only be the tubular lesion in arsenic nephritis of little moment , but also that serious injury of the tubular epithelium , as these observation due to uranium , may cause a temporary nitrogen retention . a consideration of all the fact here present allow we to conclude that although it be not possible to demonstrate that a experimental nephritis may be purely tubular or purely vascular , which be in accord with we clinical and pathological study of human material , it be possible , if we combine the result of anatomical , physiological and chemical study , to recognize lesion which be predominantly tubular or vascular , or whic 
the experimental study of poliomyelitis have yield a large number of important fact relate to the spontaneous disease in man . the nature of the virus have be discover , many of the nature of the virus property have be ascertain , some of the nature of the virus immunity effect have be establish , the clinical and pathological peculiarity of the spontaneous disease in man have be elucidate , and a basis have be secure on which to develop measure of prevention . 
highly dilute solution of the alkaline oleate , which do not suffice to alter appreciably the morphology or reproductive power of the pneumococcus , nevertheless produce profound change in the alkaline oleate structure . pneumococcus treat with sodium oleate become more subject to autolysis , as be indicate both by the rapidity and the perfection of the process of self-digestion , and at the same time the alkaline oleate become subject to serum-lysis . the serum-lysis of the soaped pneumococcus tend to be incomplete with normal serum and to be perfect with a immune antipneumococcus serum . when normal serum be employ , the survive pneumococcus subsequently multiply either in the test tube or in the animal body , in the latter case produce fatal infection . when , on the other hand , a immune serum be employ , lysis be complete , no multiplication occur , the test tube mixture be sterilize , and the inoculate animal be protect from infection . the inhibition of the inoculate animal activity which the soap ordinarily suffer in the presence of protein , can be prevent by the addition of a appropriate quantity of boric acid , so that boric acid mixture can continue to exert a deleterious and solvent influence on the pneumococcus , and the effect be greater when immune serum be employ in boric acid mixture . infection can not only be prevent when the mixture of immune serum , soap , and boric acid be add to the pneumococcus before injection into the peritoneal cavity of small animal , but the infection can likewise be prevent when a therapeutic injection of a mixture of the three substance mention be make to follow the inoculation of normal , highly virulent diplococcus . the limit of the activity of the therapeutic mixture be determine , in part by the amount of protein to be overcome , and in part by the peculiarity of the infection occur in highly susceptible animal species . the virulence of the pneumococcus be somewhat diminish by the soap treatment , but the treat organism be not render more subject to phagocytosis . the virulence of  the pneumococcus would appear that the action of the soap be exert upon the lipoidal moiety of the bacterial cell , through which the pneumococcus be render more pervious to serum constituent and bring under the pneumococcus deleterious and dissolve influence . the change in the pneuoccus here describe probably have a prototype in the resolve exudate of a pneumonic process ; so that it may be consider that the pneumococcus occur in the animal body in the course of spontaneous infection and constitute one of the condition of the conquest of the organism by the animal body in the course of spontaneous infection force . a certain conformity exist between the manner of destruction of the pneumococcus in a pneumonic exudate and that in the artificially prepared soap-serum mixture . in order to imitate outside of the animal body in the course of spontaneous infection the condition of the removal of pneumococcus within the animal body in the course of spontaneous infection , outside of  the animal body in the course of spontaneous infection do not suffice merely to study the reaction to leucocyte and serum and to conclude from the reaction the means which the animal body in the course of spontaneous infection employ for the disposal of the diplococcus ; but it be necessary to invoke still other factor , among which be the effect of chemical substance present in exudate , of which the soap represent one class . the failure hitherto to unify the reaction in test tube with those occur in the body in connection with the pneumococcus may be due to the fact that account be not take of this class of chemical body . whether the principle here present can be make applicable to the treatment of local pneumococcus infection in human being be a press question . the principle application to local pneumococcus infection , to the seat of which serum , soap , and boric acid , soap , and boric acid mixture can be directly apply , particularly after evacuation of a inflammatory exudate , seem to offer promise . 
these experiment indicate that , in obstructive jaundice , the bile which escape from the liver be absorb by the hepatic capillary and carry by the blood to the kidney . the presence of a thoracic duct fistula influence in no way the development of icterus after total obstruction of the common bile duct . bile pigment , sufficient to give a Salkowski test , may or may not appear in the lymph of the thoracic duct in such experiment , they appearance possibly depend upon the rapidity of bile secretion and the amount of lymph flow . chronic icterus develop in a animal with a thoracic duct fistula give a interesting distribution of bile pigment in the body fluid . the lymph of the thoracic duct in such experiment and pericardial fluid contain the same amount , which be much less than the content of bile pigment in the blood serum and urine . it seem clear that in both acute and chronic obstructive jaundice the lymphatic apparatus take no essential or active part in the absorption of bile pigment from the liver . at best , a secondary factor in the mechanism of jaundice be a secondary factor in the mechanism of jaundice . 
1 . Chloroform anesthesia for two hour or more will cause more or less central liver necrosis in dog , depend on the length of Chloroform anesthesia for two hour or more and the susceptibility of the animal . 2 . if the fibrinogen of the blood of such a animal be estimate at interval , it be find that this proteid show a drop correspond to the amount of liver necrosis . 3 . by administer chloroform , the fibrinogen of the blood of such a animal may be almost eliminate from the circulate blood , and the poison animal may bleed for hour from small skin prick or cut . 4 . the liver can recover from a grave injury due to chloroform and return practically to a normal condition in about ten day . 5 . the fibrinogen of the blood of such a animal reappear in the blood as the liver effect the fibrinogen of the blood of such a animal repair . it seem that a good indicator of the liver efficiency be a good indicator of the liver efficiency and a fairly accurate index of the amount of liver injury . 6 . shortly after the recovery of the liver from a injury due to chloroform , one may find a excess of fibrinogen in the blood as the liver effect the fibrinogen of the blood of such a animal repair . 7 . in severe case of chloroform poisoning , the calcium of the blood as the liver effect the fibrinogen of the blood of such a animal repair be normal or slightly increase , and the thrombin be normal . 8 . these experiment give no evidence that the formation of thrombin or prothrombin be dependent upon liver activity . 9 . the hemorrhage of chloroform poisoning be due not to lack of blood clotting but to inefficient coagulation . the clot have not the body and toughness supply by the fibrinogen of the blood of such a animal , and be , therefore , unable to check even capillary hemorrhage . 10 . fibrinogen be either form in the liver or be wholly dependent upon liver activity for the liver production . 
the work record above have serve to corroborate the observation of other writer , notably of Noguchi , that in many human serum , if not in all , there develop , on standing , anticomplementary body which be delicately thermolabile , be inactivate by heat to 56 degree c. for fifteen to twenty minute . the work record above have appear that anticomplementary body which be delicately thermolabile , be inactivate by heat to 56 degree c. for fifteen to twenty minute may occasionally be present in serum which , after heating , may develop the thermostable anticomplementary body refer to by other author . the work record above have become evident also that the speed of development of the thermolabile anticomplementary body in different serum be subject to much variation . the thermolabile anticomplementary body in different serum appear as the complement disappear . the question arise whether the thermolabile anticomplementary body in different serum may not be originally present in the serum , temporarily mask by the native complement . this would seem improbable from the fact that titration have show that 0.1 and 0.2 cubic centimeter of the inhibit serum will often inhibit as much as 0.6 cubic centimeter of fresh guinea-pig complement , a quantity superior to the amount of complement present originally in the antihemolytic serum . it seem , therefore , that the thermolabile anticomplementary body in different serum must actually be form in the serum during the period of preservation . the thermolabile antihemolytic body study by we be like the thermostabile body investigate by Noguchi , in that the thermolabile antihemolytic body study by we inhibit alien as well as homologous complement ; the thermolabile antihemolytic body study by we be unlike the thermostabile body investigate by Noguchi , in that it inhibit alien as well as homologous complement , however , in that the thermolabile antihemolytic body study by we can not be absorb from serum by digestion with red cell , nor do the thermolabile antihemolytic body study by we render the treated cell more resistant to hemolysis . the thermolabile anticomplementary body in different serum may be remove from inhibit different serum by precipitate the globulin . a solution of the glotmiin then manifest a thermolabile anticomplementary action . no relationship between a clinical condition and the appearance of these body in different serum , have be find . as a practical result these study have show , as have those of Noguchi , that the complement fixation test should never be make with certain serum which have be preserve for some time without inactivation . 
the liver tissue of man and certain animal -lrb- dog , rabbit , guinea pig , etc. -rrb- yield , upon alcoholic extraction , the liver tissue of man . while many substance be present in the alcoholic extract , the one possess the antigenic property be comparatively few . the latter be responsible for the antigenic property exhibit by the whole alcoholic extract . the substance extract with alcohol be fractionate into the follow four group . -lrb- a -rrb- substance Insoluble in Ether , Alcohol and Hot Alcohol.-These be chiefly -lrb- a -rrb- substance Insoluble in Ether and Hot Alcohol.-These . the minute particle of larger molecule hold in apparent suspension in alcohol until all other substance be remove be probably the minute particle of larger molecule hold in apparent suspension in alcohol until all other substance be remove . a essential factor in extract  the minute particle of larger molecule hold in apparent suspension in alcohol until all other substance be remove in a alcoholic solution be also a essential factor in extract the minute particle of larger molecule hold in apparent suspension in alcohol until all other substance be remove in a alcoholic solution . the salt present be the usual physiological constituent of the liver , notably , the liver . the quantity of the substance extract with alcohol vary greatly with different specimen . biologically consider , the usual physiological constituent of the liver , notably , sodium chloride be neither markedly hemolytic nor anticomplementary and possess no antigenic property for the Wassermann reaction . it be important , however , to note that the minute particle of larger molecule hold in apparent suspension in alcohol until all other substance be remove bind complement when mix with certain active human serum . for this reason the antigen preparation be unsuitable for use in combination with a active serum , and should , therefore , be reject . -lrb- b -rrb- substance Insoluble in Ether , Alcohol and soluble in hot alcohol.-this group contain soap , cleavage product of the minute particle of larger molecule hold in apparent suspension in alcohol until all other substance be remove , and small amount of the bile salt . soap and bile salt be very strongly hemolytic and be absolutely unfit for use as antigen . moreover , the antigenic property be very slight . -lrb- b -rrb- substance Insoluble in Ether , Alcohol be best to eliminate this group of substance from the antigen preparation . the quantity of the substance of this group extract from different specimen of tissue be very variable . -lrb- c -rrb- substance soluble in Ether , Alcohol , Alcohol , and aceton.-in this group extract from different specimen of tissue be find vary amount of fatty acid , both saturated and unsaturated , some neutral fat , cholesterin and many unidentified lipoidal body . this group extract from different specimen of tissue cause either hemolysis or inhibition , of hemolysis . in other word , this group extract from different specimen of tissue be this group extract from different specimen of tissue . at the same time , in some preparation the same time be , to a certain extent , antigenic . this great variation in the amount of these substance in give extract render they presence in the antigen preparation undesirable . it be not deny , however , that , when add in adequate quantity , some of these substance in give extract may improve the activity of the antigenic lipoid . -lrb- d -rrb- substance -lrb- b -rrb- substance Insoluble in Ether , Alcohol in Aceton.-This group of substance consist of phosphatid . the best know among phosphatid be , of course , lecithin . besides lecithin , however , there must be various other phosphatid present in the most important . it will be notice that the precipitate form by mix the ethereal solution with aceton contain a certain amount of lipoid insoluble in ether as well as in alcohol . before the fractionation in aceton , all lipoid be soluble in ether or ethyl alcohol . further analytical work on the nature of various other phosphatid present in this fraction contain in the most important be necessary . the most important , in general , be more constant in amount in the various liver extract . biologically consider , the most important be the most important . the most important be usually non-hemolytic , frequently anticomplementary , but much more strongly antigenic than the other fraction . the antigenic strength vary with different preparation , be almost absent in the extract derive from fatty liver . a aceton insoluble fraction may be strongly antigenic without any other auxiliary effect , or may be accompany by a anticomplementary property . the most important do not cause the so-called non-specific reaction with a active human serum . for these reason it be recommend -lrb- as Noguchi have repeatedly do before -rrb- that the antigen should be select from the aceton-insolub 
the follow conclusion may be draw from the foregoing series of experiment . the complementary activity vary within a definite limit in different specimen of guinea pig serum . with serum which stand in contact with the clot for twenty hour , 0.013 cubic centimeter and   be in the ratio of 0.015 cubic centimeter to 0.04 cubic centimeter . the former be 2.66 time stronger than the latter . the variation observe with the same series of serum which stand in contact with the clot for twenty hour after forty-six hour , while some serum become be still more striking . 0.013 cubic centimeter be    the former the latter . these finding agree with those make by Massol and Grysez . the variation be not so marked with the majority of serum which stand in contact with the clot for twenty hour . it be noteworthy that a large number of the serum gain in the complementary activity when remain in contact with the clot for twenty hour for forty-six hour , while some serum become , while some serum become weaken during the same length of time . the amount of serum fix by give constant quantity of syphilitic serum and antigen vary much more markedly than the variation in those make by Massol and Grysez the complementary activity . one serum fail altogether to be fix . on the other hand , one sample of serum be so easily fixable that 0.24 cubic centimeter -lrb- correspond to 9.6 complement unit of this specimen -rrb- disappear , while only 0.098 cubic centimeter -lrb- correspond to 4.64 complement unit -rrb- be only 0.098 cubic centimeter -lrb- correspond to 4.64 complement unit -rrb- . the normal standard of fixability be show in about 50 per cent . of the specimen examine . if the zone of normal fixability be enlarged in both direction by one unit , the percentage of normal fixability would become 65.8 . there be no definite relationship between the complementary activity and the fixability of a give specimen of guinea pig serum . the fact derive from we present experiment , especially in regard to the exception in the fixative quality of guinea pig serum , demand the utmost precaution from those intend to employ the utmost precaution for diagnostic purpose , as , for example , in the Wassermann reaction . no quantitative work be possible with the complement fixation reaction unless the experimenter be capable of determine the fixability of the serum in use . one of we -lrb- Noguchi -rrb- have long realize this source of error , and in order to reduce one of we -lrb- Noguchi -rrb- Noguchi have advise the employment of a mixture of serum which stand in contact with the clot for twenty hour from more than two guinea pig . 
1 . the maximum activity of a antihuman hemolytic amboceptor may be obtain by employ the homologous or heterologous complement , accord to the variable relation exist between the species furnish a antihuman hemolytic amboceptor and the one supply the homologous or heterologous complement . thus , some amboceptor be best reactivate by the complement of the same species , while other may act most strongly when reactivate with the above complement of certain suitable heterologous species . 2 . from the above it be clear that the complementary activity of a give serum may be very variable accord to the variety of amboceptor employ . in express the complementary activity of a give serum , the species of the host of a antihuman hemolytic amboceptor must always be state . thus , one serum may have many different complementary titer accord to the amboceptor use . a similar variation in the titer of the amboceptor use occur when a variety of complement be employ . 3 . certain species of animal -lrb- pig and sheep -rrb- yield serum which be comparatively poor in reactivate most variety of antihuman amboceptor . the above complement of these species deteriorate rapidly . 4 . the serum of chicken contain but little complement for the amboceptor derive from the mammalium , while the amboceptor from the chicken be only poorly , or not at all , reactivable by the above complement contain in the mammalian serum . the only variety which reactivate  the amboceptor from the chicken in a fair degree be the only variety which reactivate the amboceptor from the chicken in a fair degree . 5 . for the fixation test guinea the most favorable be the most favorable . the most favorable be also the most active and durable of those which have be study . the above complement of pig and sheep be quite fixable , but the above weakness and rapid deterioration render the above unsuitable for fixation purpose . rabbit complement be quite active but be not easily fixable . goat complement be , as already state , difficult to fix , in spite of goat complement strong complementary activity . the other complement be unsuitable because of the above feeble complementary activity . 6 . for fixation test the antihuman amboceptor produce in the rabbit and guinea pig be suitable . the antihuman amboceptor produce in the rabbit and guinea pig be , moreover , very active and do not cause the phenomenon of non-fixation . the amboceptor from no other animal be unsuitable , as we can not find a complement which strongly reactivate the amboceptor from  no other animal . the amboceptor from the goat be unsuitable because of the danger of mask the fixation phenomenon by subsequent hemolysis . 7 . in sum up , we arrive at the conclusion that the best animal for produce antihuman amboceptor be the best animal for produce antihuman amboceptor , and the guinea pig for supply complement . the guinea pig for supply complement produce a good amboceptor , but the guinea pig for supply complement small size render its small size second in choice . so far , no other animal have be find useful for the fixation experiment . 
the fix property of a specific precipitate and of syphilitic serum in the presence of certain antigenic lipoid , can be remove by add certain non-complementary protein of blood serum or hen 's egg . this disappearance of the complementary activity in the syphilis reaction , as well as in the true Bordet-Gengou reaction , be this disappearance of the complementary activity in the syphilis reaction , as well as in the true Bordet-Gengou reaction . the presence or absence of the complementary property in these protein component do not influence fixation . whether the disappearance of the complementary activity during the phenomenon of so-called fixation be due to a mechanical precipitation of the molecule through absorption or whether the disappearance of the complementary activity during the phenomenon of so-called fixation be due to a physico-chemical alteration of the active molecule , be unknown . it be more probable that a chemical interaction take place in the case of the syphilis reaction . certain serum , for example , those derive from man and goat , show a low fixability . it be interesting to note that a low fixability be gradually diminish when these serum and egg-white be heat to a temperature above 56 degree c. , and totally disappear at 85 degree c . the coagulation of protein with absolute alcohol or by boil , destroy those derive from man and goat interfere property . the fact that              this disappearance of the complementary activity in the syphilis reaction , as well as in the true Bordet-Gengou reaction be not selectively direct towards complement , have a very important meaning for exact serology . the one-sided accuracy as to the complementary unity be no longer sufficient for quantitative work . both the complementary and the volumetric unity of a serum serve as the source of complement should be take into consideration . besides , the fixability of the serum of various species of animal must also be consider . from these fact a formulum may be derive for decide the degree of the suitableness . see PDF for equation x be the degree of suitableness ; K , the species constant for a low fixability ; p , the complementary activity during the phenomenon of so-called fixation ; and v , the volume of serum . PDF for equation x will be see that the suitableness be proportional to the fixability constant and the complementary unity , and inversely proportional to the volume of serum employ . as to what species yield the largest value for x , we refer the reader to we study publish elsewhere . 
the cutaneous lesion in pellagra consist of a early erythema , or , in occasional case , of vesicle or bullous formation which be follow by hyperkeratosis and pigmentation , result in a dry , dark brown scaliness . these various lesion be similar to those normally produce by the action of sunlight , but be much more marked . the histological phenomenon of the erythematous and bullous stage be the histological phenomenon of the erythematous and bullous stage , together with a degeneration in the superficial layer of the corium . follow a degeneration in the superficial layer of the corium , which involve not only the general connective tissue but the connective tissue of the blood vessel , there be a reparative change evidence histologically by a increase cellularity of the corium and the presence of fibroblast . the capillary also be increase in number and much dilate . apparently as a result of this increase vascularity of the corium , there be a increase proliferation of the epithelium result in a thicken of the epidermis . this increase in thickness of the epithelial layer be especially mark in the prickle cell and the stratum granulosum . in the later stage , in a effort to secure a firm basement membrane , the epithelium result in a thicken of the epidermis be see to dip down deeply into the rarefy connective tissue . about the blood vessel during the reactionary process be find collection of lymphoid cell , a few plasma cell , lymphoid cell or eosinophile . that the irritant produce the corium be the irritant produce     the corium , be suggest by the enormous increase in pigment formation in the epithelial cell and by the large number of chromatophore in the corium . this pigmentation be autochthonous in both type of cell . there be no reason for believe that the pigment be form in the cell of the corium and thence discharge into the epithelium result in a thicken of the epidermis , or that the reverse process take place . a lessened resistance of the epithelium to the violet and ultra-violet ray , due to some metabolic insufficiency on the part of   the epithelial cell be , apparently , a lessened resistance of the epithelium to the violet and ultra-violet ray , due to some metabolic insufficiency on the part of the epithelial cell . further observation may justify the conclusion that throughout the body , pellagra be a disease essentially of the epithelium result in a thicken of the epidermis , include this pathological condition manifest itself by a insufficient or altered function , this pathological condition manifest the body by a insufficient or altered function . 
1 . hypertrophy induce by the production of aortic insufficiency involve all the chamber of the heart . the greatest absolute increase in weight be in the left ventricle . the remain segment , arrange in the order of decrease increment be the auricle . the greatest relative increase be also in the left ventricle , but the auricle show a relative hypertrophy greater than that of the remain segment or right ventricle . 2 . the co-hypertrophy of the auricle be not due to a altered venous pressure , but result from a increase force of auricular systole . 3 . the heart show a increase in weight within one week after the production of aortic insufficiency . a increase in weight be due only in part to a increase water content . 
the so-called syphilitic antibody can be remove from a serum by means of absorption with that barium sulphate . the removal be due either to a adsorption or a mechanical absorption . the activity of the so-called syphilitic antibody be thereby unimpaired . the readiness with which a mechanical absorption be accomplish with that barium sulphate vary considerably with different syphilitic serum . that barium sulphate exert the same absorbing effect upon non-syphilitic serum component be make evident by the interfere property which the latter manifest in a mechanical absorption experiment of the so-called syphilitic antibody . the selective removal of the other serum component , by means of barium sulphate absorption be , therefore , impossible . on the other hand , a partial removal of non-syphilitic serum component be make evident by the interfere property , with but little removal of the so-called syphilitic antibody , may be effect when the content of a give serum be poor in the so-called syphilitic antibody and comparatively rich in the indifferent serum component . but this be impossible if the condition be reverse . the main reason why some negative syphilitic serum may be so modify by the barium sulphate treatment as to give positive reaction , be explain below , but these apply only to those method in which inactivate serum be employ . the inactivation reduce the antibody content to about one-fourth to one-fifth of the original . when a give serum be very rich in the so-called syphilitic antibody , this do not affect the result of the fixation test . but when the amount of the antibody be small , the process of inactivation create the condition quite unexpected . the amount of the antibody may produce such a condition that a give amount of the serum contain , after inactivation , only one or two antibody unit , while the other serum component remain undiminished . here one must not lose sight of the vital fact that these apparently indifferent serum constituent be not at all indifferent in the fixation process . these apparently indifferent serum constituent may possess affinity which be similar to those of complement for the fix combination of syphilitic serum and antigen . speak quantitatively , one unit of the so-called syphilitic antibody plus antigen will fix 0.1 cubic centimeter of guinea pig complement , but one unit of   the so-called syphilitic antibody plus antigen can also be saturate and block by nearly the same amount of the seemingly indifferent serum component of the serum to be test . moreover , 0.2 cubic centimeter , a quantity sufficient to saturate two unit of   the fix combination of syphilitic serum and antigen be 0.2 cubic centimeter , a quantity sufficient to saturate two unit of   the fix combination of syphilitic serum and antigen ,   0.2 cubic centimeter , a quantity sufficient to saturate two unit of   the fix combination of syphilitic serum and antigen , a quantity sufficient to saturate two unit of   the fix combination of syphilitic serum and antigen . fortunately , this self-saturation of the syphilitic antibody-antigen combination by the other serum component be not constant in occurrence , owe to the wide variation of the fixability of the serum component of man . here the benefit of Wechselmann 's procedure become obvious . by remove a surplus of the fixable indifferent serum component by means of barium sulphate absorption , a give serum be make to react positively , or more strongly than before the barium sulphate treatment . this masking of the positive reaction through this self-saturation of the syphilitic antibody-antigen combination by    the other serum component be liable to occur in any system in which inactivate serum be recommend . another equally important factor in mask the positive reaction through  this self-saturation of the syphilitic antibody-antigen combination by    the other serum component in a serum in which the so-called syphilitic antibody be poor , be another equally important factor in mask the positive reaction in a serum in which  the so-called syphilitic antibody be poor . another equally important factor in mask the positive reaction in a serum in which  the so-called syphilitic antibody be poor be a plain and simple fact that a excess of hemolytic amboceptor render a positive reaction feeble or completely negative . as we have show in we present investigation , a hemolytic amboceptor can be remove from a give serum by means of absorption with that barium sulphate . thus it be easy to understand why Wechselmann 's find that barium sulphate absorption improve the reaction in the original Wassermann system . the treatment of syphilitic serum with this salt can have a twofold benefit in the case of the original method of Wassermann ; namely , the removal of certain interfere the fixable indifferent serum component and the removal or diminish of the natural antisheep amboceptor present in the syphilitic serum . in the method of Noguchi , there be no necessity for apply t 
1 . under certain condition , mechanical agitation destroy the complementary activity of guinea pig serum . it be most injurious when carry out constantly at a temperature of 37 degree c. , but a temperature of 37 degree c. be extremely insignificant at 10 degree c . after the first few hour at 37 degree c. , the destruction of complement proceed much more rapidly , and after six hour six hour be almost complete . on the other hand , within one hour shake have almost no destructive effect on complement , even at 37 degree c. from this we may conclude that the several shaking which be necessary for fixation experiment during incubation do not modify perceptibly the outcome of the reaction . 2 . the rate of destruction of the complement of guinea pig serum at temperature above 45 degree c. be progressively greater as the rate of destruction of the complement of guinea pig serum at temperature above 45 degree c. approach 55 degree c. , at which temperature the complementary activity of guinea pig serum be reduce in thirty minute to one-thirtieth to one-fortieth of the original strength of the unheated serum ; but it be not completely destroy , as be commonly assume . the velocity of destruction of the complement of guinea pig serum at temperature above 45 degree c. complement when expose to 55 degree c. for various length of time be find to be quite irregular , and not proportional to the length of time . this irregularity , however , present a certain rhythm , a certain rhythm . 
implant mixture of mouse embryo and tumor sometimes result in a excellent growth of both . to assure this , it be necessary that the tumor select be one which proliferate slowly , because more active one prevent the development of the fragment of embryo . transplant embryonic tissue -lrb- of the type use -rrb- do not , at the type use best , grow as rapidly or in so large a percentage of host as some tumor . the morphological relation between tumor and embryonic tissue in the mixed graft be often intimate . apparently either may adapt the other to the other structural purpose . occasionally a direct union take place between cancerous epithelium and that of mouse embryo and tumor , with result in picture suggest a origin of one from the other . this observation have considerable significance in view of the current reliance upon just such histological datum to prove that cancer arise from normal epithelium . 
1 . the graft , will grow well in case  the graft no longer carry young . the growth be no more rapid than that in favorable nonpregnant alien , but persist for a longer period without retrogression and result in a greater variety of tissue . the superiority of auto-transplantation over iso-transplantation be responsible for this fact . no evidence of a specific `` growth-substance '' peculiar to the pregnant state be furnish by the experiment . 2 . when a mouse be implant with embryonic tissue from a specific `` growth-substance '' peculiar to the pregnant state own uterus , and a specific `` growth-substance '' peculiar to the pregnant state still carry develop young , the fate of the graft be very different from that just describe . that just describe be vascularize from the host but fail to grow or differentiate . yet that just describe do not die , and after pregnancy be conclude that just describe may start to grow . the finding be strikingly like that note by other of implant tumor in pregnant host . it seem probable that some general factor affect the growth of implant tissue be here concern . 
1 . the description of two distinct type of aestivo-autumnal crescentic parasite give by Craig in Osler 's Modern Medicine -lrb- with difference in extremity , amount and form of pigment , double-outline , etc. -rrb- , I have be unable to confirm . 2 . the crescentic parasite be throughout the crescentic parasite entire existence extracellular -lrb- i. e. , not within the substance of the red corpuscle , but attach to the crescentic parasite surface -rrb- . the crescentic parasite develop from the familiar small ring-form parasite , retain a circular contour until fully mature . 3 . the very young ring-form parasite have no capsule ; the macrogamete have one during the macrogamete development and sexual activity ; while the microgametocyte have the microgametocyte only during the microgametocyte the macrogamete development . 4 . the Sexual Cycle of the crescent may occur in the circulate blood of the Sexual Cycle of the crescent human host . the Sexual Cycle of the crescent be probably very rapid , for practically the whole cycle can be see in a few smear take from one puncture . the microgametocyte , or male , develop a flagellum -lrb- microgamete -rrb- which , after the parasite , certainly during the sexual phase and probably have assume the crescentic phase , leave the body of the parasite , certainly during the sexual phase and probably and enter the body of the macrogamete , or female , during the parasite , certainly during the sexual phase and probably the crescentic parasite entire existence as a round body . fertilization be then accomplish . 5 . the microgametocyte , after the escape of a flagellum -lrb- microgamete -rrb- which , after  the parasite , certainly during the sexual phase and probably have assume the crescentic phase , leave the body of  the parasite , certainly during the sexual phase and probably and enter the body of the macrogamete , or female , during the parasite , certainly during the sexual phase and probably the crescentic parasite entire existence as a round body , show evidence of degeneration and be probably cadaveric . 6 . after fertilization , the macrogamete assume the crescentic form , reach the reproductive phase and undergo sporulation , the product of which appear to be the familiar small ring-form parasite , the familiar small ring-form parasite then take place . 7 . that the Sexual Cycle of the crescent be not see oftener in the circulate blood of man may be due to one or more of the follow reason : -lrb- a -rrb- the process of reproduction may be and probably be very rapid -lrb- some form of protozoan be exceed in rapidity of reproduction only by bacterium -rrb- . -lrb- b -rrb- the Sexual Cycle of the crescent may usually take place in some of the internal organ . -lrb- c -rrb- the Sexual Cycle of the crescent may be that the Sexual Cycle of the crescent occur in the peripheral blood only at interval , when the Sexual Cycle of the crescent become necessary for the parasite to renew the Sexual Cycle of the crescent exhaust vitality . -lrb- d -rrb- the occasional occurrence of the sexual cycle in the circulate blood of man may be due to some slight chemical change in the composition of its human host blood serum . 8 . I find no good evidence of conjugation-form in aestivo-autumnal malaria . I find some of the young ring form parasite in close approximation or overlying each other . as the Sexual Cycle of the crescent do take place in the circulate blood of man , such a process of conjugation would seem unnecessary , unless the Sexual Cycle of the crescent occur as a atypical process . the fact that the crescent be more resistant to quinine than the other variety of malarial parasite might be explain by the presence of a capsule which appear to protect the parasite , certainly during the sexual phase and probably , certainly during the sexual phase and probably during the '' rest '' period -lrb- when not undergo sexual change -rrb- . the youngest form of ring parasite show no evidence of encapsulation . this may explain the fact that  the crescent be more resistant to quinine than the other variety of malarial parasite that quinine be best administer just before the paroxysm when  the parasite , certainly during the sexual phase and probably , certainly during the sexual phase and probably be undergo segmentation . 
1 . two important method for the study of malarial pigment be describe . -lrb- a -rrb- a method for obtain a solution of malarial pigment from fixed tissue without the removal of a trace of hemoglobin from the red blood corpuscle . -lrb- b -rrb- a method for obtain a iron reaction in malarial pigment . 2 . by compare the bleach reaction and solubility of melanin and malarial pigment , the dissimilarity of the two class of pigment have be demonstrate . 3 . the spectroscopic examination of a solution of malarial pigment prove conclusively that the pigment be hematin . 4 . it be suggest that the most probable mode of elaboration of malarial pigment be the most probable mode of elaboration of malarial pigment . 5 . the difficulty with which the human organism dispose of malarial pigment indicate that the production of hematin can not be consider as a normal intermediate process in the formation of bile pigment from hemoglobin . 
from a study of strongyloide infection in man and animal in this region , a study of strongyloide infection in man and animal in this region have be determine , in its confirmation , that      its confirmation be not causative factor in the production of diarrhea . the mother worm , however , burrow into the mucosa and deposit Grassi ovum there . certain tissue reaction take place and be evidence by the cellular proliferation in those portion of the intestine occupy by the nematode . in animal in this region , there be a associated anemia , not positively attributable to the strongyloide , but , on the other hand , not attributable to any other cause . it be possible that S. stercoralis may cause some degree of anemia in man . the amount be indeterminable in this region among hospital case on account of the associate hookworm disease or malaria . portal of entry for various microörganisms be make by the female mother worm and S. stercoralis larva in the small intestine , and , while no case of general bacterial infection have be prove to have arise in this way , no case of general bacterial infection occurrence be possible and highly probable . in the culture of strongyloide of man , there be among native , who presumably be infect with purely tropical strain , a very marked predominance of development by the indirect or sexually differentiate mode , in some case , a absolutely pure culture of the indirect mode larva be obtain , who presumably be infect with purely tropical strain , a very marked predominance of development by the indirect or sexually differentiate mode , in some case , a absolutely pure culture of the indirect mode larva be obtain . there be , however , native , who presumably be infect with purely tropical strain , a very marked predominance of development by the indirect or sexually differentiate mode , in some case , a absolutely pure culture of the indirect mode larva be obtain , who presumably be infect with purely tropical strain , a very marked predominance of development by the indirect or sexually differentiate mode , in some case , a absolutely pure culture of the indirect mode larva be obtain native , who presumably be infect with purely tropical strain , a very marked predominance of development by the indirect or sexually differentiate mode , in some case , a absolutely pure culture of the indirect mode larva be obtain , who presumably be infect with purely tropical strain , a very marked predominance of development by the indirect or sexually differentiate mode , in some case , a absolutely pure culture of the indirect mode larva be obtain . culture from native of the temperate zone contain a marked predominance of the direct phase larva . the presence of the filariform -lrb- direct mode -rrb- , larva be perhaps the presence of the filariform -lrb- direct mode -rrb- , larva the presence of the filariform -lrb- direct mode -rrb- , larva . from a correlation of culture study with the result of a histological examination of the invade mucosa , this explanation of the derivation of the two phase be suggest . the mother worm in the intestinal tract have two kind of progeny : -lrb- a -rrb- those expel into the crypt or luman , and -lrb- b -rrb- those imbed in the intestinal wall . one lot become the indirect phase larva . it appear to I that the intraepithelial cell-developed larva furnish    , while the embryo expel directly from the mother become the indirect phase larva . this will require for this confirmation a study of culture in connection with a histological examination of the infected intestinal wall . Cold merely inhibit the development of the larvgammaaelig ; into either the filariform -lrb- direct -rrb- or into the sexually differentiate adult , and do not alter the anlage .         be         , and all chemical larvicide must be direct against           . Thymol and a alkaline cresol resin soap be find to be effective larvicide for the filariform larva . two new strongyloide of the monkey and ant bear be describe . culture of the nematode show a predominance of the indirect mode of development . 
1 . the serum of rabbit inject repeatedly with the nucleoprotein , globulin , and albumin of the liver and kidney of the dog give no evidence in vitro or in vivo experiment of organ affinity . the precipitin test offer no proof of the specificity of these serum for the protein employ as antigen . 2 . the anaphylaxi reaction apply to the same protein indicate a slight relative organ affinity but no specificity as far as the respective protein fraction be concern . a slight relative organ affinity reside , rather , in the globulin and albumin fraction than in the nucleoprotein fraction . dog serum use both as a sensitize and a intoxicating agent give rise to very active cross reaction with the same protein indicate a slight relative organ affinity , thus fail to support the theory of organ or of no specificity as far as the respective protein fraction . 3 . these result do not support the view put forward that the nucleoprotein play a important part in the course of production of cytotoxic immune serum . 
in conclusion , it may be say that the lesion describe consist of a selective impregnation of the elastic tissue in the splenic trabecula and vessel with the phosphates-and perhaps other salts-of calcium and iron . there be a further chemical change in the elastic fiber which may be express by the term `` elacin . '' degenerate and , especially , calcified elastic tissue-even more than calcification in general-seem to possess a affinity for iron salt . the iron incrustation occur principally in congested or hemorrhagic tissue . the etiological agent in this case be obscure . the only other example of this lesion in the spleen be in a case of Banti 's disease . many feature of this case suggest a primary splenomegaly , but the evidence in this case favor be not conclusive . calcified elastic fiber , without the iron and elacin reaction , be also present in the liver , which be the seat of a recent , apparently biliary or infectious , cirrhosis . the elastic tissue of other organ show nothing remarkable except in the skin , where calcified elastic fiber be undergo the usual senile change . 
the injection of virulent culture of bacillus influenza into the subdural space of several species of lower monkey be follow by the development of a acute inflammation of the meninx , correspond in clinical , bacteriological , and pathological effect with influenzal cerebrospinal meningitis in human being . experimental influenzal meningitis in the monkey be a lethal disease which terminate fatally in from thirty-six hour to four day after the inoculation . the inject influenza bacillus produce clinical , bacteriological , and pathological effect through multiplication in the course of which bacillus influenza into the subdural space of several species of lower monkey penetrate from the subdural space , of arrest the progress of a experimental influenzal meningitis into the general blood current , from which bacillus influenza into the subdural space of several species of lower monkey may be recover during life and at autopsy , as be also true of the spontaneous form of influenzal meningitis in man . by repeat injection , over a period of many month , of live bacillus influenza into the subdural space of several species of lower monkey into the goat , a immune serum possess moderate agglutinate and high opsonic power may be produce , which be capable , when inject into the subdural space , of arrest the progress of a experimental influenzal meningitis , of arrest the progress of a experimental influenzal meningitis , and of bring about recovery in monkey thus affect . as a result of the serum injection , the influenza bacillus in the meninx be more freely englobe by phagocyte , bacillus influenza into the subdural space of several species of lower monkey number be reduce , bacillus influenza into the subdural space of several species of lower monkey capacity of growth diminish , and the eruption into the general blood current arrest . along with these clinical , bacteriological , and pathological effect go , hand in hand , cessation of the local inflammatory process and progressive amelioration of the symptom of illness , to be follow usually by rapid restoration of health . in view of the highly fatal character of influenzal meningitis in human being , the employment of a immune serum by subdural injection be recommend . Undoubtedly it will be necessary to apply a immune serum by subdural injection early and by repeat injection , by means of lumbar puncture , to secure beneficial result . the early application will , in turn , be dependent upon prompt bacteriological diagnosis , which can be make , as a rule , by the immediate microscopical examination of the cerebrospinal fluid without the employment of cultural method . when possible , the microscopical diagnosis should be confirm by cultural test . 
the result of these experiment be definite . there be , in a very striking difference with regard , a very striking difference with regard to precipitate formation between the acid and alkaline solution of salvarsan when inject intravenously . intravenous injection of the acid and alkaline solution of salvarsan produce no precipitate in the blood , while injection of the acid solution nearly always give a precipitate . furthermore , after the acid solution , there be a striking difference between the blood from the right side of the heart and that from the left side . at the end of injection of first the acid solution , a precipitate be seldom present in the arterial blood ,  the blood . blood take from the left ventricle at this time -lrb- at autopsy -rrb- also show no precipitate , in three a doubtful trace of precipitate , and in one a definite small amount in a large majority of case ; in eight experiment there be no precipitate , in three a doubtful trace of precipitate , and in one a definite small amount , in three a doubtful trace of precipitate , and in one a definite small amount . on the other hand , the blood from the right ventricle show a very different condition . in ten out of twelve animal -lrb- rabbit and dog -rrb- ,    contain a definite precipitate , and in a number of these case the amount of precipitate be large . blood squeeze from  the blood from the right ventricle show in eight out of ten case at least as much precipitate as be find in the blood from    . the result of intravenous injection of    the acid and alkaline solution of salvarsan , as point out before , be quite different from those produce by the acid and alkaline solution of salvarsan . in thirteen experiment upon dog and rabbit , three a doubtful trace of precipitate be find in the arterial blood ,  the blood , the blood from the left ventricle at this time ,    , or  the blood from the right ventricle . there be no apparent difference in the process of precipitate formation whether the acid and alkaline solution of salvarsan and the blood be mix in vivo or in vitro . in both mixture the acid and alkaline solution of salvarsan produce a precipitate , while the acid and alkaline solution of salvarsan do not . these experiment have demonstrate the fact itself that a precipitate be present in the blood after a injection of first the acid solution . one would expect that such a precipitate , consist as such a precipitate usually do of rather coarse particle , would , if bring to the medullum , cause immediate death by produce embolus . however , the freedom from such occurrence may be explain by the fact itself that the precipitate , which be abundantly present in      , which be abundantly present in    , be only rarely see in blood take from the carotid or femoral artery or even from  the precipitate , which be abundantly present in      , which be abundantly present in      . the fact the freedom from such occurrence , however , be quite difficult to interpret . it might perhaps be assume that  the precipitate , which be abundantly present in      , which be abundantly present in      be filter out during  the precipitate , which be abundantly present in      , which be abundantly present in      passage through the lung capillary . if the case be the case , we might expect intravenous injection of    the acid and alkaline solution of salvarsan to produce embolism in the pulmonary vessel with consequent fatal result . as a matter of fact , we have in the recent literature a instance which seem to point to such a result . Miessner -lrb- 6 -rrb- try the effect of salvarsan in cattle which have the foot and mouth disease . Miessner -lrb- 6 -rrb- use at first the acid solution , and though the dose be small , seven milligram per kilo of body weight , all the animal -lrb- four -rrb- , all the animal -lrb- four -rrb- die in from ten hour to two day after a injection of     first the acid solution . they all show labor respiration during or soon after a injection of     first the acid solution . Miessner -lrb- 6 -rrb- then decrease the dose to five milligram per  body weight , all the animal -lrb- four -rrb- , all the animal -lrb- four -rrb- , and repeat these experiment . Miessner -lrb- 6 -rrb- use also normal animal as control upon those which have the foot and mouth disease . both the sick and normal -lrb- control -rrb- animal show labored respiration . one die after four day . at autopsy all organ except  the blood from the right ventricle appear to be normal .  the blood from the right ventricle present the follow appearance : there be grayish yellow spot scatter irregularly over the surface . on the cut surface these be see as grayish yellow spot scatter irregularly over the surface the size of a pea , which appear in group and which sometimes fill a lobule completely . other spot be surround by a small area of dark red lung parenchyma . the affected portion contain no air and feel solid . in adjacent part the tissue seem normal . a microscopic exam 
these result seem definitely to show , through animal experiment , that phagocytic immunity be to a high degree specific for the organism use in immunization , and that the amount of opsonin produce in the process depend to a great extent on the virulence of the organism use in immunization . the negative result obtain with post-critical serum do not mean that opsonin may not be present -lrb- we five positive case indicate opsonin presence -rrb- , but opsonin emphasize strongly the fact that opsonin be not form to any great extent . therefore this study add further support to the view that although opsonic immunity be produce in pneumonia , this study be not the only means of defense possess by the body , and by this study this study can not explain the crisis . 
1 . rat sarcoma may be cultivate in mouse plasma and guinea pig plasma , and the growth differ only in extent from that observe in rat plasma . the cell may show active wander in guinea pig plasma after thirty day , if transfer at proper interval to fresh medium . 2 . rabbit plasma be less suitable than that of guinea pig and mouse for the growth of rat sarcoma ; growth be slow , but rabbit plasma may continue for twelve day . 3 . the duration of growth of rat sarcoma in dog plasma be from two to three day . 4 . four to five day be four to five day . transfer the tissue to fresh pigeon plasma do not lengthen the period of activity . 5 . no growth whatever be observe of mouse and rat tissue in goat plasma . study of the fate of the cell indicate the presence in goat serum of a substance toxic for mouse and rat tissue . 6 . in preparation of rat sarcoma in human plasma , liquefaction of fibrin be regularly observe . the phenomenon of growth consist in a outwandering of cell along the cover glass , and , after four to six day , the formation of giant cell . such giant cell be produce in larger number in the cultivation of rat spleen . 7 . the degree of suitability of the different kind of alien plasma use as culture media for mouse and rat tissue do not go hand in hand with the closeness of relationship of the species . 8 . rat spleen may be cultivate as readily in foreign plasma as the virulent transplantable tumor . 
repeated experiment have prove that few , if any , of the ordinary laboratory and domestic animal be immune against infection by bacillus lepra . as previously report , the goat , horse , guinea pig , and many cold-blooded animal -lrb- couret -rrb- have be find susceptible to invasion by this organism . two factor be of great importance in effect infection . in the first place , a sufficiently large number of organism must be employ , and , what be still more important , second and subsequent inoculation be more liable to produce leprous lesion than be primary injection . moderate dose use in the first inoculation of animal which have recover from previous injection be comparatively harmless as regard they ability to induce leprous lesion . such preliminary dose , whether they consist of living or dead organism , produce a condition of hypersensitiveness or allergy , which render the first inoculation of animal possible by a second injection of viable bacillus to induce the development of a reactionary lesion . these lesion develop more rapidly , increase in size more quickly , and persist for a longer period than those take place as the result of a single inoculation , even though very large dose be use . moreover , the bacillus in these lesion be more liable to lead to metastasis and to a generalize infection . we regard the result of repeated experiment as have considerable bearing upon the development of the disease in human case , since we find that the development of the disease in human case be chiefly among those live in prolonged intimate contact with leprous patient that human leprosy develop . the proper interpretation of these finding be difficult and become , apparently , more complex the longer those live in prolonged intimate contact with leprous patient be study . we be accustom to similar phenomenon of anaphylaxi or allergy with protein material and with especially the tubercle , especially the tubercle the bacillus . it be not surprising that a specific allergy or altered reaction should take place in animal previously inject with leprosy bacillus , either alive or dead ; why , however , leprous lesion should develop in which leprosy bacillus continue to grow in animal which have recover from previous injection , or the serum of which show bactericidal property and contain other specific antibody , be not so easily understand . it be unnecessary in this paper to discuss the relative value of the different theory bring forward to explain the phenomenon of anaphylaxi . this paper must , nevertheless , be assume that either as the result of the splitting of certain essentially non-toxic substance in the bacillus by specific ferment-like substance in the blood , which increase after a sensitize dose , or by the join of some body in the serum with certain substance in leprosy bacillus , a toxic body be produce . follow the set free or development of these injurious body , there result a cellular reaction , a area of local necrosis follow usually by the appearance of cell of the lymphoid and epithelioid type , and , especially if dead bacillus be use , by polymorphonuclear leucocyte . such a reaction be usual in all allergic or anaphylactic condition ; but why such a reaction should pre-dispose to the more or less permanent development of parasitic power on the part of leprosy bacillus be not so plain . the idea have be express by we , as the result of observation base chiefly upon the study of the change in the tissue of human leprosy , that the presence of the bacillus in  the large multinucleated cell of a reactionary lesion be the presence of         the bacillus in  the large multinucleated cell of  a reactionary lesion rather than of phagocytosis by the large multinucleated cell , although it be possible that the set free original entrance may be the set free original entrance . if the case be the case , it be possible that , through a cellular reaction plus the necrosis of certain of the fix tissue cell , a pabulum of split protein product result upon which the bacillus feed , and in which the set free find protection from the antibody present in the blood serum . in we attempt to induce infection in various mammalian species with culture of human leprosy , positive result have be obtain in 
1 . lesion of the testicle and scrotum of the rabbit produce by the treponema of syphilis and of yaw afford material for the study of chemotherapy , of serum reaction , and of immunity . 2 . on experimental and clinical grounds , it appear that yaw can be cure with a smaller dose of salvarsan than be necessary to cure syphilis . 3 . the spirochaeta of syphilis do not become resistant after repeat treatment with salvarsan . 4 . sodium cacodylate have little effect on the treponema of syphilis of either disease . 5 . Mercury , in a single intravenous dose , have a spirillicidal effect , but the necessary dose usually cause the death of the animal later from nephritis . 6 . potassium iodid , in a single intravenous dose , have a spirillicidal effect . 7 . the complement fixation reaction be closely correlate with the course of a infection , as be show by the complement fixation reaction onset and the complement fixation reaction onset disappearance after castration or treatment . 8 . reinfection during the course of a testicular lesion do not occur , but reinfection during the course of a testicular lesion occur after regression , treatment , or extirpation . 9 . specific difference between treponema pallidum and trepanema pertenue can be demonstrate in infected animal treat with salvarsan and reinoculate . 
in conclusion , it may be point out that the first time that treponema pallidum of Schaudinn have be prove beyond all doubt to have be obtain in pure culture be the first time that treponema pallidum of Schaudinn have be prove beyond all doubt to have be obtain in pure culture . the method of cultivation describe would appear also to be suitable for obtain indefinite generation of the microorganism . doubtless slight modification will adapt the method of cultivation describe to a larger number of strain and possibly to the cultivation of all strain and to still other species of treponema . finally , it may now be accept as establish that the testicular lesion produce in rabbit by means of syphilitic material be the result of the multiplication of the pallida and not of some associate indefinite parasite . 
subdural inoculation of tubercle bacillus of established virulence for guinea pig and rabbit , produce in the dog a tuberculous meningitis , follow by paralysis and death . when suspension of canine leucocyte be inject subdurally , follow such inoculation there occur uniformly a delay in the development of paralysis and death and a prolongation of the life of the treat animal . in dog inoculate with small dose of tubercle bacillus of low virulence , the development of  paralysis and death have be prevent by this mean for period of seven month -lrb- up to the present date -rrb- , while the untreated animal inject with the same culture have all develop paralytic symptom within a period of about four week . 
the electrocardiographic record take during the stimulation of each vagus by pressure from child suffer with chronic heart disease have show that the stimulation of the vagus in these case be strikingly effectual . in some of these case , a definite difference be demonstrate between the action of the right and leave the vagus in these case . the control of the rate of the heart-beat seem to predominate usually in the right vagus nerve , while the control of stimulus conduction from the auricle apparently predominate usually in the left vagus . this difference in the two nerve probably exist on account of the difference in the right vagus go especially to that part of the heart which control the rate of contraction , the sinus node above the right auricle , and the left vagus go especially to that part in which the conduct mechanism be find , the right vagus go especially to that part of the heart which control the rate of contraction , the sinus node above the right auricle , and the right vagus go especially to that part of the heart which control the rate of contraction , the sinus node above the right auricle , and the left vagus go especially to that part in which the conduct mechanism be find . each nerve , however , have to a lesser degree the function which predominate in the other . the whole heart seem to respond , as a rule , more promptly to right than to left vagus pressure , and fairly constant difference have be see in the effect which stimulation of each nerve have on the various wave of the electrocardiogram . the stimulation of each vagus may influence directly the contraction of the ventricle , whose inherent rhythmicity be apparently unaffected by right vagus stimulation , cause great diminution in the electrocardiogram force . right the stimulation of each vagus be follow at time by a complete dissociation of the auricle . the auricular rhythm be slow sufficiently at this time to allow the ventricle , whose inherent rhythmicity be apparently unaffected by right vagus stimulation , whose inherent rhythmicity be apparently unaffected by right vagus stimulation , to take up the auricle own independent rhythm . the heighten ventricular rhythmicity in these case allow this to take place after only moderate slow of the auricle . the independent ventricular rhythm be sometimes establish in the region of the node of Tawara , for no disturbance of the ventricular portion of the electrocardiogram occur . at another time , some other point in  the ventricle , whose inherent rhythmicity be apparently unaffected by right vagus stimulation , whose inherent rhythmicity be apparently unaffected by right vagus stimulation inaugurate the stimulus of the independent ventricular contraction and a abnormal electrocardiogram result . the resemblance of we curve , show dissociation , to those obtain during right vagus and leave accelerator stimulation in dog be definite . that analogy , the clinical picture , and the form of the electrocardiogram of these case have lead we to the belief that a important feature in the pathological physiology of these case be a important feature in the pathological physiology of  these case . this factor , as a cause of symptom and as a hindrance to the establishment of cardiac rest , may prove of great importance , against which a new form of cardiac therapeutics must be direct . 
1 . Splenectomy in dog result in a immediate increase of the cell , due to the manipulation involve in a normal cell count . a immediate increase of cell in the thoracic duct lymph be soon follow by a low cell count , attributable to the removal of a important source of the cell under consideration . several month after    a normal cell count a normal cell count be reëstablished , due probably to a readjustment of activity on the part of other cell-forming tissue . 2 . pilocarpin injection after splenectomy result in a increase of the cell , attributable to a increase activity of the respiratory organ and of the intestine . 3 . after the injection of pilocarpin , splenectomy may increase    a normal cell count , but the injection of pilocarpin cause a decrease sooner than in case of pilocarpin injection not follow by splenectomy . 
I have describe the successful cultivation of two distinct species of treponema from the oral cavity of man . two distinct species of treponema differ from one another morphologically and in respect to they cultural property . as two distinct species of treponema have now be clearly separate and cultivate for the first time , I propose for they the name treponema microdentium and macrodentium , respectively . Division along the longitudinal axis have be demonstrate for both treponema macrodentium and treponema microdentium . when the micro - and macrodentium be cultivate under imperfect anaerobic condition , both treponema macrodentium and treponema microdentium undergo involution , but still continue to vegetate to some extent . finally , merely a involuted form of  both treponema macrodentium have be cultivate and describe merely a involuted form of  both treponema macrodentium may be merely a involuted form of both treponema macrodentium , or it may be a new species altogether . 
a method for the direct cultivation of treponema pallidum from human syphilitic lesion , by the employment of a solid medium , have be describe . by means of a method for the direct cultivation of treponema pallidum from human syphilitic lesion , three of the four strain work with be successfully cultivate . the several pure culture agree in morphological and cultural character , grow only in the presence of sterile tissue under anaerobic condition , and do not produce putrefactive odor . the morphology be typical under optimum cultural condition ; it become atypical when optimum cultural condition be unfavorable . in the several pure culture , treponema pallidum multiply by longitudinal division . the process be usually symmetrical but occasionally appear to be asymmetrical . inoculation of the pure culture into the skin of two species of lower monkey be follow by the production of lesion resemble the primary syphilitic lesion occur in man and those cause in the monkey by inoculation of spirochaetae-containing serum from human source . during the course of the positive inoculation in the monkey , the blood develop the property of give a positive Wassermann reaction . thus the relation of treponema pallidum to a positive Wassermann reaction be support , and the identity of the cultivate strain with two species of lower monkey find in human syphilitic lesion establish . 
in my three case of intestinal infantilism , the kreatinin excretion be more irregular than normally , and the kreatinin coefficient be low . Kreatin be find in the urine on a kreatin-free diet . the sum of kreatinin and kreatin be also irregular . the endogenous uric acid be irregular from day to day . the kreatin excretion be apparently lower on a high fat diet than on a high carbohydrate diet . 
in three case of intestinal infantilism , the excretion of nitrogen in the urine per square meter of body surface be low . the heat radiation be normal . in spite of the fact that the absolute quantity of nitrogen be low , the distribution of nitrogen and sulphur among the various nitrogen and sulphur constituent of the urine per square meter of body surface be in the normal ratio . the ammonia excretion be normal . the ethereal sulphate be slightly increase . the respiratory coefficient show that the supply of glycogen have not be use up after eighteen hour ' starvation . 
the direct inoculation of a sarcoma of the fowl into the develop chick embryo or the develop chick embryo membrane have yield growth in many case . the best result have be obtain with graft of the living tumor tissue , but , as in the adult , growth in many case can be engender with dry tissue or with the Berkefeld filtrate of a tumor extract . when live the living tumor tissue be use , a actual transplantation occur . the neoplasm develop be spindle-celled sarcoma , remarkably uniform in structure , and similar to those in the adult fowl , except that in the embryo the neoplastic cell be often extremely long and slender , and the structure of the growth be very loose . the develop chick embryo membrane adapt those in the adult fowl in a remarkable way to the support of the tumor . in those in the adult fowl , the growth be seldom invasive ; and while regional metastase be occasionally see , none occur by the bloodstream , despite the predilection of the growth for this path of distribution in adult host . in the more resistant structure of the growth , a invasive extension of a sarcoma of the fowl into the develop chick embryo or its membrane occur . growth originally in the yolk-sac outside the chick may be carry into the latter during the course of development . secondary growth in the viscera may cause the death of the host some week after hatch . in order to produce the tumor in the embryo the neoplastic cell be often extremely long and slender , the sarcoma cell or the agent engender the growth must be bring into a direct association with the mesodermal tissue . this necessity be responsible for interesting difference in the location of the growth in the various membrane . a sarcoma of the fowl into the develop chick embryo or its membrane will grow in the membrane of pigeon or duck embryo , whereas in adult of these species a sarcoma of the fowl into the develop chick embryo or its membrane will not do so ; and in chicken embryo of different variety , a sarcoma of the fowl into the develop chick embryo or its membrane grow uniformly well , a finding not obtain in adult of these species . in embryo host of all the sort mention , there be a total absence of the cellular reaction which in adult of these species indicate resistance to the tumor 's development . relatively speak , the embryo the neoplastic cell be often extremely long and slender seem much more favorable than the adult as a host for a sarcoma of the fowl into the develop chick embryo or its membrane . 
the numerous attempt make in the last twenty-five year to reproduce lobar pneumonia in the animal practically fail in all instance . by intrabronchial insufflation of pure culture of pneumococcus in dog , we produce experimental pneumonia successively in forty-two case , with a mortality of at least 16 per cent . the fatal case resemble closely lobar pneumonia in man . in the non-fatal case , the pathological and bacteriological finding be again in accord with the finding in man . clinically , however , the case of nonfatal experimental pneumonia run a milder and shorter course than in man . in a few instance , lobar pneumonia have be produce experimentally also with the pneumococcus mucosus and with friedländer 's pneumobacillus . the anatomical finding in these experiment have show some characteristic agree with the finding in the pneumonia of man produce by these organism . the quantity of the inject culture , through which mechanical effect a favorable opportunity be provide the pneumococcus to develop and display they pathogenic activity consist in the call forth of a characteristic local , more or less effective , widespread , inflammatory reaction of the lung tissue seem to have a definite influence upon the outcome of the disease ; in the fatal case larger quantity of the inject culture , through which mechanical effect a favorable opportunity be provide the pneumococcus to develop and display they pathogenic activity consist in the call forth of a characteristic local , more or less effective , widespread , inflammatory reaction of the lung tissue have be inject . the animal be neither select nor prepare in any manner . the experimental success do not , therefore , appear to depend upon the degree of resistance of the individual host . it be suggest that the uniformly successful result of these experiment be due to the obliteration of a large number of bronchus by the inject culture , through which mechanical effect a favorable opportunity be provide the pneumococcus to develop and display they pathogenic activity consist in the call forth of a characteristic local , more or less effective , widespread , inflammatory reaction of the lung tissue , through which mechanical effect a favorable opportunity be provide the pneumococcus to develop and display they pathogenic activity consist in the call forth of a characteristic local , more or less effective , widespread , inflammatory reaction of the lung tissue . 
when many culture of treponema pallidum , whether obtain from the testicular lesion produce in rabbit or directly from human case of syphilis , be compare , certain definite difference in morphological character become apparent . the different specimen can be divide into thicker and thinner form or type , and thicker thicker . the last be the last , but the other two occur with sufficient frequency and retain they character with such constancy as to constitute distinct variety . indeed , two of the varieties-the average and the thinner-occurred in association in a chancre and be separate afterwards in many culture of treponema pallidum , whether obtain from the testicular lesion produce in rabbit or directly from human case of syphilis . the gross cultural property of the three variety present no point of distinction . the testicular lesion produce in rabbit cause in the testicle of the rabbit differ accord to the variety inoculate , and consist either of a diffuse or of a nodular orchitis . a highly important distinction be a highly important distinction , and if , in the study of a still larger number of specimen of pallida , the study of a still larger number of specimen of pallida be maintain , the study of a still larger number of specimen of pallida be capable of throw light on certain important clinical feature of the human syphilitic disease . the thinner variety of treponema pallidum resemble in morphology treponema microdentium , from which the thinner variety of  treponema pallidum be unmistakably distinguish by cultural character . the morphological and pathogenic variation in treponema pallidum may constitute racial difference within the species . 
although the result of this study have be of a negative character , the conclusion that may be draw from this study have a important bearing on the true anatomical character of the island . 1 . neither inanition nor the prolonged injection of secretin have any noteworthy effect upon the number , size , or structure of the island of langerhan in the dog 's pancreas . 2 . the island of langerhan in the guinea pig 's pancreas be in no way alter in phlorizin diabetes . 3 . the island of langerhan in the guinea pig 's pancreas be not form out of exhaust or degenerate acinus , but develop from the duct or acinus with which they be often in direct continuity . 
what be believe to be the first known case of heart-block arise in a dog as a result of a ingenerate pathological lesion be here report . the auriculo-ventricular dissociation be of that degree know as relatively complete block and become apparent on section of the right vagus nerve . stimulation of the peripheral end of the cut vagus fail to inhibit the ventricle , although complete inhibition of the auricle occur . the same result be obtain during the ventricular acceleration produce by strophanthin , so that the failure of the vagus to inhibit the ventricle be not due to the latter 's infrequent action , but more probably to a normal lack of direct chronotropic influence upon the ventricular muscle . these finding be similar to those obtain by Erlanger in experimental heart-block . to small repeated dose of strophanthin inject intravenously the heart react as follow : -lrb- a -rrb- irregular slowing of the auricle and conversion of the relatively complete into a absolutely complete a-v block ; -lrb- b -rrb- a rise in the irritability of the cardiac muscle manifest by a rapidly progress auricular and ventricular frequency , the ventricular frequency surpassing a rapidly progress auricular and ventricular frequency ; -lrb- c -rrb- complete arrest of the auricle , the ventricle continue at the auricle high rate ; -lrb- d -rrb- sudden fibrillation of the ventricle and shortly afterwards arrest in diastole . there be find post mortem myxomatous-like thickening at the free edge of the septal tricuspid leaflet and at the attach margin of the posterior aortic leaflet and along part of the right anterior aortic leaflet . there be also a grayish patch on the right side of the auricular septum above the auriculo-ventricular junction . the thickening at the edge of the valve consist of dense , circumscribed mass of what appear to be new connective tissue . the same tissue be find press against the bundle along the greater part of the latter 's course . there be considerable fatty infiltration of the auricular musculature immediately above the bundle along the greater part of   the latter 's course and , to a slight extent , of the auricular musculature . the fiber of communication between the cardiac muscle manifest by a rapidly progress auricular and ventricular frequency , the ventricular frequency surpassing ultimately the auricular frequency ; -lrb- c -rrb- complete arrest of  the auricle , the ventricle continue at the auricle high rate ; -lrb- d -rrb- sudden fibrillation of  the ventricle and shortly afterwards arrest in diastole and the node of Tawara be relatively few as compare with those of the normal heart . a review of the pathology of heart-block be append , show the present status of the question , concern the relationship exist between disease of the a-v conduct system and the various grade of heart-block . 
in sum up the result of these investigation attention be call in particular to the following fact . dead pneumococcus culture material do not contain the active poison form in infection by live pneumococcus . characteristic lesion be not induce by dead culture . but substance be present in the pneumococcus cell , and especially in culture filtrate free from the pneumococcus cell , that give rise to a immunity in which the poison of virulent pneumococcus be inactive . in immune serum specific agglutinative , precipitative , lytic , and opsonic activity be present . but to the action of immune serum , virulent pneumococcus be singularly insusceptible . this be due chiefly to this these quality . in the test-tube this insusceptibility be overcome only under exceptional condition which destroy these quality or neutralize this effect . lysis may be bring about by inhibition of growth , and phagocytosis by loss of virulence . in the tissue inhibition of growth and resistance to the poison of the pneumococcus be bring about , but in way more subtle if less exceptional , for both lysis and phagocytosis be both lysis and phagocytosis . 
from the result of this study of the action of immune serum on pneumococcus infection it be evident that immune serum on pneumococcus infection vary greatly in they curative value . immune serum on pneumococcus infection possess protective action , but protective action be not necessarily indicative of curative action . treatment with the serum of normal rabbit may prolong the course of pneumococcus infection in the rabbit . the action of immune serum on pneumococcus infection , however , be slight and not always manifest . Sera from animal immunize with dead pneumococcus cell which have be wash free from they product , fail to exert materially greater curative action than normal serum . Sera from the animal free from dead pneumococcus cell which have be wash free from they product possess , in some instance , a slight curative value , but often materially greater curative action be not apparent . in the animal actively immunize , however , the presence of a immunity to  the animal be readily demonstrate . in the immunity produce by injection of dead culture material the strength be not sufficiently exalted for the serum to possess a practical curative value . the immunity produce by injection of dead culture material be only after immunization with virulent living culture that the blood serum acquire marked curative action . after pneumococcus infection in the rabbit have become establish , the blood serum induce crisis and cure the animal . from the result of the study of the mechanism of recovery it be evident that , despite the fact that virulent pneumococcus be singularly insusceptible to the action of immune serum in the test-tube , pneumococcus infection nevertheless conform to the general law of infection . diphtheria and tetanus organism give rise to powerful toxin , but the parasitism of diphtheria and tetanus organism be slight and virulent pneumococcus development be localized . disease produce by diphtheria and tetanus organism be disease produce by  diphtheria and tetanus organism and neutralization of virulent pneumococcus toxin by antitoxin put a end to the disease . the pneumococcus give rise to toxic substance which be less active or be active only in the body tissue , but the parasitism of this organism be marked and the parasitism of this organism virulent pneumococcus development be rarely localized . nevertheless , the manifestation of the disease arise from the action of the bacterial poison on the body tissue . the neutralization of the pneumococcus poison by immune serum put a end to the symptom of the disease , but virulent pneumococcus survive as harmless parasite until destroy by lysis or phagocytosis . the neutralization of the pneumococcus poison may take place suddenly and completely as in crisis ; or , the neutralization of the pneumococcus poison may be incomplete with exacerbation of infection , as in lysis . crisis , as the neutralization of the pneumococcus poison occur in the lobar pneumonia of man and in the bacteriemia of the rabbit , be simply one phase of recovery , and recovery do not differ fundamentally , whether crisis , as the neutralization of the pneumococcus poison occur in the lobar pneumonia of man and in the bacteriemia of  the rabbit be sudden and complete as in crisis , or incomplete and prolonged as in lysis , or whether virulent pneumococcus be destroy by lysis extracellularly as in the rabbit , or intracellularly as in the phagocytosis of the dog and man . since the recovery of animal from pneumococcus infection differ in no essential from that of man , since the unaided protective mechanism of man as compare with that of susceptible the animal be exceptionally efficient , and since the recovery of animal from  pneumococcus infection be possible by treatment with serum from animal highly immunize with live culture of virulent pneumococcus to cure pneumococcus infection in the most susceptible animal , it be difficult to conceive of the infection in man fail to yield similarly to the administration of such serum . 
1 . in plasma there exist a vasodilator substance specific for the vessel of the kidney . 2 . a vasodilator substance be a proteid of the albumin class and be precipitate by boil and by alcohol . 3 . 3 be present also in the serum . 4 . 4 act directly on the muscle coat of the artery . 5 . the process of clotting of the blood liberate a constrictor substance that act on the renal vessel and also on the vessel of the limb . 6 . a constrictor substance that act on the renal vessel and also on the vessel of the limb be not a constrictor substance that act on the renal vessel and also on the vessel of the limb ; a constrictor substance that act on the renal vessel and also on the vessel of the limb resist boil , be soluble in alcohol , and act directly on the muscle coat . 
when intrabronchial insufflation of pure culture of the streptococcus or of the influenza bacillus be properly carry out , the streptococcus produce without fail a pneumonic lesion . a pneumonic lesion be similar in a pneumonic lesion nature to the one know in human pathology as bronchopneumonium , and differ materially from the pneumonic lesion produce experimentally by the intrabronchial insufflation of pure culture of the pneumococcus . consider the fact that none of the dog use in the experiment with the pneumococcus and none of those use in the present investigation be select or prepare in any way , the conclusion seem to be unavoidable that the determine factor in the development of pneumonia be the determine factor in the development of pneumonia , the determine factor in the development of pneumonia . furthermore , since different organism introduce in the same way and under condition which be apparently the same produce distinctly different pneumonic lesion in animal of the same species , the further conclusion present the same way that the different type of pneumonia be produce by specifically different bacterium . however , further investigation may show that the difference in the nature of a pneumonic lesion be due rather to the degree of virulence of the causative microörganism than to difference in the same species ; the same species be , that distinctly different pneumonic lesion may possibly be produce by the same species , provide those use in the present investigation possess different degree of virulence . further experimentation may also show that the leading factor in determine the course and outcome of the disease , may be the leading factor in determine the course and outcome of    . 
injection of oil of turpentine into the peritoneal cavity of a dog call forth immediately a exudate of fluid from the surrounding tissue . the amount of fluid reach the maximum on the third day and have practically disappear on the fifth day . the cell content of this fluid be very small at first , but increase rapidly . the type of the predominate cell also change . in the early exudate the small mononuclear cell be the small mononuclear cell the small mononuclear cell . later the number of large mononuclear cell be increase and ultimately the polymorphonuclear cell preponderate . various form of atypical cell also occur . much of this fluid and many of atypical cell be remove by they way . the count of the cell in   they way and the estimate base on these indicate that   they way do not remove all of the fluid or cell that be usually find there from the peritoneal cavity of a dog . much fluid be probably take back directly into the blood , as be many of atypical cell . some of atypical cell make some of  atypical cell way to the lymph node , while many perhaps undergo complete autolysis in the serous cavity . the polymorphonuclear cell do not enter   they way in great number . examination of the lymph from the thoracic duct in the case of my dog show the type of cell that be usually find there . the variation in the small mononuclear cell be so related to the cell content of the peritoneal effusion as to indicate that the supply in the blood be maintain from this source . the form and staining quality of atypical cell indicate that many of the small mononuclear cell be return to   they way . the ratio of polymorphonuclear cell present in the lymph from the thoracic duct in the case of my dog bear no definite relation to the other feature of the process . the transitional cell be increase in number and in many of    the small mononuclear cell the ratio of polymorphonuclear cell present in  the lymph from the thoracic duct in the case of my dog to other cell . the increase in the transitional type accompany a increase in the small mononuclear cell and a decrease in small mononuclear . none of the atypical form of cell find in the peritoneal effusion be see in the lymph from the thoracic duct in the case of my dog . the number of eosinophil be without apparent relation to the other feature of the process . no polymorphonuclear cell contain the pigment inject be find in the lymph from the thoracic duct in the case of my dog , and the number of mononuclear cell contain pigment be small . much pigment be deposit in the lymph node . detailed and definite conclusion as to the relation between polymorphonuclear cell present in  the lymph from the thoracic duct in the case of my dog and those of the peritoneal effusion can not be arrive at satisfactorily without repeat observation on the same animal . Dr. Warthin examine many of the smear from these case and frequently control the conclusion regard the various type of cell that be usually find there . Dr. P. F. Morse assist my frequently with the operative procedure and with the routine counting of atypical cell . 
a analysis of the result of the experiment report in this investigation show that the change so frequently observe in tissue surround a grow tumor may be cause by different condition . the development and growth of a malignant tumor depend upon a local interaction between tumor cell and organ cell . when the cell of a normal organ be capable of inhibit the tumor growth , then a impairment of the normal state of the parenchymatous cell of this particular organ be essential for the tumor growth . this `` precancerous state '' do not consist primarily of a inflammatory change in the adjacent connective tissue , as Ribbert 's and Ribbert 's follower maintain , but in a degeneration of the parenchymatous cell of this particular organ . if , in another instance , the cell of the normal organ be unable to inhibit the proliferation of tumor cell and organ cell , then no preparation of the cell of the organ for a malignant tumor be necessary , i. e. , this `` precancerous state '' be need to enable the tumor to grow . on the other hand , the proliferate tumor cell injure the cell of the normal organ , either mechanically or chemically , produce a condition that appear on superficial examination like that describe as this `` precancerous state '' . '' in reality , however , a condition that appear on superficial examination like that describe as    this `` precancerous state '' be the resultant effect of the tumor growth and may be more correctly designate the `` postcancerous state . '' in different condition , then , von Hansemann 's explanation of the phenomenon , and not Ribbert 's , seem to be the correct one . of still the fact demonstrate in the last series of experiment ; namely , that the general condition of resistance or immunity to cancer growth exert a greater influence on the organism of the animal than any of the local condition describe above be the fact demonstrate in the last series of experiment ; namely , that the general condition of resistance or immunity to the growth of cancer exert a greater influence on the organism of the animal than any of the local condition describe above . the local resistance of a testicle to tumor growth in a generally susceptible animal may be overcome , but if a animal be make generally immune to the growth of cancer , neither the animal as a whole nor a single organ or tissue in a animal can be make susceptible to the tumor growth . 
the analysis of the experiment describe above indicate that the tumor acquire a different biological character from those inoculate subcutaneously . the latter be a great deal more benign in those inoculate subcutaneously behavior than human cancer or spontaneous tumor in the same species of animal .  the tumor , on the other hand , be quite identical in those inoculate subcutaneously biological behavior with the malignant tumor of animal and man . a conclusion must then be draw , even a priori , that a very important aid in the experimental investigation of cancer be a very important aid in the experimental investigation of cancer . it be true that a very important aid in the experimental investigation of cancer be a great deal more complicated and time-consuming than the ordinary subcutaneous inoculation . the subcutaneous method be satisfactory for a number of cancer problem . one of these be one of these , and a subject of paramount importance in cancer research be a subject of paramount importance in cancer research . on the other hand , the investigation of the writer -lrb- 10 -rrb- have show that a animal may be susceptible to a subcutaneous inoculation of a certain tumor and resist the inoculation of the same tumor into the testicle . Undoubtedly the subcutaneous method of inoculation will reveal the existence of a number of other phenomenon . the greatest problem in  cancer research be certainly the greatest problem in cancer research . a great deal of work have be do already on a subject of paramount importance in cancer research , and the latest investigation of Wassermann on the chemotherapy of experimental tumor seem to be of great promise . but here also the therapeutic method must be try on animal in which the inoculation of tumor cell have be make into  the tumor before the growth thus treat will have any analogy to human cancer . in this connection one must bear in mind the fact that all the empirical so-called specific cancer remedy , which be continually be devise , be usually successful in treat localized skin cancer and fail utterly in the malignant growth of the internal organ . it be comparatively easy to produce a localized necrosis and softening in a circumscribe growth of the skin and subcutaneous tissue , but whether the same result will be produce on a diffuse and better nourished tumor grow inside of a parenchymatous organ can not be decide a priori . to determine this it be necessary to have experimental proof on better nourished tumor grow inside of a parenchymatous organ animal in which the inoculation of tumor cell have be make into   the tumor before the growth thus treat will have any analogy to human cancer . 
in experiment I a group of ameboid cell be isolate from a culture of cardiac muscle sixty-three day old , and cultivate in plasma . after several passage , cultivate in plasma form a dense tissue from which ameboid cell radiate . a culture of cardiac muscle sixty-three day old , and cultivate in plasma be divide into two part . the part cultivate in plasma alone keep the part cultivate in plasma morphological character and continue to produce ameboid cell . the part cultivate upon silk in plasma become modify ; ameboid cell lose the part cultivate in plasma morphological character ameboid character , and be transform into large elongate cell which be unite in chain , or interlaced to form a network . in experiment ii the round cell take from a culture of connective tissue seventy-four day old multiply rapidly . the part cultivate in plasma morphological character ameboid character transform the part cultivate in plasma morphological character ameboid character into elongate cell that belong to a definite type and produce , after a few passage , a mass of dense connective tissue . from a dense tissue a large number of elongate cell that belong to a definite type be constantly grow . in both experiment the tissue originate from the ameboid or round cell extirpate from these culture . these culture be still grow actively thirty and forty day later ; that be , more than one hundred day after the extirpation of the original fragment from the organism . both experiment show that from these culture it be possible to isolate and propagate cell that belong to a definite type . a tissue , form by a pure strain of cell that belong to a definite type , can be obtain in this way , and this new method may be of value in cytological investigation . 
the result in the group in which there be no interagglutination differ in no striking way from those obtain in the group in which there be no interagglutination . it may be conclude , therefore , that the presence of isoagglutinin be of no importance for the final result of the homoplastic transplantation of artery . from the conflict evidence of the survival of muscular fiber in one case and isoagglutinin disappearance in many other case , the conflict evidence of the survival of muscular fiber in one case and isoagglutinin disappearance in many other case may be conclude further that between animal of the same species there be unknown biological difference that prevent , in most instance , the survival of homoplastic transplant artery , although a survival do occur in some case . 
1 . by introduce intravenously into dog a solution of 5 per cent . ether in normal saline -lrb- 0.9 per cent . -rrb- , a satisfactory surgical anesthesia can be produce . 2 . associate with this anesthesia a glycosurium occur in healthy adult dog feed on a meat diet . 3 . normal saline -lrb- 0.9 per cent . -rrb- introduce in exactly the same manner do not cause a glycosurium . 4 . a glycosurium be , in general , associate with a hyperglycemia . 5 . a glycosurium do not make a glycosurium appearance until the condition of anesthesia have be produce . 6 . the intravenous method of produce anesthesia employ in we study eliminate largely the factor of asphyxia . 7 . consequently by this mode of administration ether may cause glycosurium without asphyxia . 8 . the addition of ether to normal saline -lrb- 0.9 per cent . -rrb- solution modify the property of the latter to produce diuresis . 9 . associate with the intravenous administration of both the saline and the ether-saline solution there occur a rise of body temperature . 
1 . a mucin-producing spirochoeta have be obtain in pure culture from a case of pyorrhea alveolari . this organism be a independent species of the genus treponema and , as this organism be recognize for the first time , I propose for this organism . 2 . morphologically the mucosum be difficult to separate from the pallidum and microdentium , but , through the mucosum biological property and animal reaction the mucosum be easily differentiate from all the rest of the spirochoeta . 3 . the mucosum be not parasitic in the strict sense of the term , but exert a certain pyogenous action when the tissue have be so injure by foreign substance as to enable the tissue to survive . 4 . the strong fetid odor in the discharge from pyorrhea alveolari be due , at least in part , to the presence of the mucosum in the affect tissue . 
1 . a method for the pure cultivation of spirochoeta duttonus , spirochoeta kochus , spirochoeta obermeierus , and spirochoeta novyus be describe in this paper . in vitro these strain reach spirochoeta duttonus maximum growth after seven , eight , or nine day at 37 degree c. for spirochoeta duttonus multiplication spirochoeta duttonus require the presence of a piece of fresh sterile tissue and a body fluid capable of form a loose fibrin with the tissue . the presence of some oxygen seem indispensable for spirochoeta duttonus maximum growth , since spirochoeta duttonus fail to grow in a atmosphere of hydrogen or in vacuo . spirochoeta duttonus maximum growth be obtain at room temperature . 2 . from culture that show a good growth subculture can be make and a good growth can be keep up in this way for many passage . 3 . the pathogenicity of these organism be not lose by cultivation , although there be a tendency for the virulence to become attenuate after growth in vitro have continue for a long time . 4 . longitudinal division have be observe and be follow under the dark-field microscope in fresh preparation from culture that show a good growth . the dark-field microscope in fresh preparation occur in all the species irrespective of the length of the organism . transverse division seem also to occur , but I have not yet observe the entire process . 
1 . a method be describe for obtain pure culture of treponema pallidum and ally species of spirochaeta in fluid media . 2 . the principle of a method be base upon the superposition of a favorable culture medium upon a less favorable one . 3 . the method here describe be not suit to the growth of spirochaeta in fluid media when spirochaeta in fluid media be admix with contaminate bacterium . 
rabbit leucocyte , inject into the basal meninx of the dog , in dose from 0.7 to one cubic centimeter apparently invariably cause death . horse leucocyte , inject in the same amount , cause death in about 25 per cent . of the dog . . the injection of foreign leucocyte into the meninx of monkey cause few if any symptom . the injection of from one to three cubic centimeter of horse leucocyte into the meningeal cavity of the dog , simultaneously with the inoculation of the meninx with tubercle bacillus , cause a slight delay in the development of the paralytic symptom in about half the treated animal . a slight delay in the development of the paralytic symptom , however , be very slight when compare with the remarkable prolongation of the latent period previously observe after treatment with dog leucocyte . the injection of foreign leucocyte into the meningeal cavity of monkey have thus far give almost uniformly negative result . in one small group of monkey , however , inoculate by the method of lumbar puncture , the injection of rabbit leucocyte have be associate with a prolongation of the latent period in one of the treat monkey , and with a complete prevention of the subsequent tuberculosis in a second monkey . 
the experiment have show that tissue extract , accelerate the growth in intro of the connective tissue from about three to forty time . this activate power be find in many tissue . this activate power be much more marked , however , with the extract of embryo , of adult spleen , and of the Rous sarcoma . this activate power diminish directly with the dilution of the extract of embryo , of adult spleen , and appear not to apply to the tissue of a heterologous animal . this activate power be reduce when heat at 56 degree c. , and remove when heat at 70 degree c . this activate power be diminish markedly by filtration through a berkefield filter and be completely suppress by filtration through a Chamberland filter . possibly the finding of the activate power of tissue extract will have no immediate practical application . nevertheless , the finding of the activate power of tissue extract may be indirectly useful by lead to the discovery of some of the factor determine the growth of the tissue of a heterologous animal and of the unknown law of cell dynamics , and may ultimately throw light on the mechanism of the cicatrization of wound . 
analysis of the principal known basis and acid of the fece in case of infantilism in which excessive amount of calcium be be lose , and comparison with case which be normal in this respect , show that the fat , fatty acid , and volatile acid be not high , and lead to the conclusion that the loss of calcium be not secondary to the presence of large quantity of phosphate , fatty acid , or volatile acid . 
1 . the Negri body , as the etiological agent in rabies , present two general type or phase in morphology , in growth , and in reproduction . 2 . these two phase be constantly cyclic in they development and correspond -lrb- 1 -rrb- to a multiplicative , or schizogonous , and -lrb- 2 -rrb- to a reproductive , or sporogonous , life cycle . 3 . by the detailed study of these form and they succeed stage we be incline to believe that the Negri body be the Negri body , and from a study of they life history we be lead to place they in the suborder of cryptocyst , or Microsporidia , of the Sporozoa , and more definitely among the oligosporogenea of the Glugeidae family , which form produce but one pansporoblast . with the recent advance in the growth of tissue outside the body , particularly the work of Carrel , Burrows , Harrison , Lewis and Lewis , and Rous upon the infectiousness of tumor extract , with the result of Noguchi in cultivate pathogenic treponema pallidum , important discovery concern the Negri body will undoubtedly be make in the near future . 
1 . the development of the polymorphonuclear leucocyte from a mesenchymal , lymphoid type of cell be possible in adult life and in vitro in chicken bone marrow . 2 . these cell can rapidly proliferate by means of amitotic division of a unripe form very similar to , but smaller than themselves . 3 . all the cell of chicken bone marrow can undergo a transformation to a type of cell resemble , although not prove to be identical with the cell of connective tissue . 
1 . the specific lipase of immune hemolytic serum be not necessary for hemolysis , but this do not prove the non-necessity of a lipolytic action in serum hemolysis , since a lipase be always present in the complement serum . 2 . the specific lipase of immune hemolytic serum be find in the end-piece of split complement . 3 . there be a parallelism between the lipase content and complement strength of the serum of different animal -lrb- man , rabbit , guinea pig , sheep , ox , cat -rrb- . 
during pneumonia the metabolism of inorganic substance deviate markedly from the normal . while chlorine , sodium , and calcium be retain in the body , potassium and magnesium be excrete normally or in excess . two case show a definite loss of magnesium to the body in the febrile period . during the period of retention the chlorine content of the blood be distinctly lower than normally , the calcium content be apparently slightly lower , and the magnesium content tend also to be a little lower . the skin be show , to play no special part in the chlorine retention . since no organ or organ have be show to store up large amount of the retain substance , it be probable that they be spread diffusely throughout the body . 
intramuscular injection of salvarsan and neosalvarsan in rabbit always produce necrosis of the muscle . a much more intense reaction be produce by salvarsan than by neosalvarsan . the rate of absorption of the arsenic be very slow , while follow intramuscular injection of neosalvarsan between 75 and 85 per cent of the arsenic be absorb during the first week . the subsequent absorption be quite slow . 
1 . on the surface of genital or anal lesion , either syphilitic or non-syphilitic , there may be find occasionally a spirochaeta resemble treponema pallidum , but somewhat thicker than the latter . in general characteristic , this organism occupy a intermediary position between treponema pallidum treponema pallidum . 2 . treponema be obtain in pure culture from two case . for this organism the name of treponema calligyrum be propose . 3 . treponema calligyrum be non-pathogenic for monkey and rabbit . 4 . treponema calligyrum can be distinguish from treponema pallidum , treponema microdentium , treponema macrodentium , treponema mucosum , and  treponema pallidum either by the morphology , cultural and biological property , or all these condition in combination . 5 . under certain cultural condition treponema calligyrum become thinner and may cause some difficulty of differentiation from a strain of the thick type of treponema pallidum , especially when the latter be grow under condition which lead to the appearance of thicker specimen and by supply   treponema pallidum with condition of growth that favor the development of individual that be thinner and more regularly curved somewhat thicker . there be no such difficulty when the average and thin type of treponema pallidum be concern . on the other hand , by provide the calligyrum in general appearance with condition which lead to the appearance of thicker specimen and by supply  treponema pallidum with condition which lead to the appearance of thicker specimen and by supply   treponema pallidum with condition of growth that favor the development of individual that be thinner and more regularly curved ,  treponema pallidum may be make to resemble the calligyrum in general appearance ; but under identical cultural condition  treponema pallidum can be readily distinguish . 
it be impossible from any point of view , morphological , biological or serological , to draw a sharp divide line in this series . the form change gradually from the mycelial organism to the bacillary , acid-fast organism . the mycelial organism be biologically a group complex and should be so consider . no doubt experiment with a larger series of species would yield result give a possibility of closer classification and the introduction of some of the form now in a debatable position , as bacillus diphtheria and bacillus malleus , and other organism , sometimes call , on account of some of  the form morphological irregularity , corynebacterium and mycobacterium , would help to show some of  the form real relation to both the Streptothrices and the true bacterium . the latter in many way be acknowledge to be far from primitive ; some of  the form endospore , flagellum , and food habit all indicate a relatively high degree of specialization . hence the latter in many way would seem biologically more reasonable to look upon this group of streptothrice with some of  the form endospore variable morphology and close relationship as represent the ancestral type that give rise to both the higher fungus and the true bacterium , and not as be some of  the form endospore higher bacterium . the various bacterium , other than the acid-fast form , can readily have arise from the non-acid-fast bacillary type , or even as non-acid-fast specialization of the mixed type . all the various form show at present by the bacteria,-coccus , spirillum , bacillus , etc.,-either separate or in chain and mass , be to be recognize in this group of streptothrice with some of  the form endospore variable morphology and close relationship , and specialization in one or another line in the past would readily have give rise to the type we consider the true bacterium . the process of evolution have carry the bacteria,-coccus far away from the parent stock and make the bacteria,-coccus into this group of streptothrice with some of  the form endospore variable morphology and close relationship . the recognition of a group complex and of the intermediate form indicate clearly the past history and present relation of these interesting organism . present relation of these interesting organism may be represent by the follow scheme . see pdf for structure it be probable that the relation between the acid-fast organism and the Streptothrices be a closer one than that between the Streptothrices the true bacterium , perhaps close enough to warrant a common genus for both . 
the experiment record in this paper confirm the observation of Friedberger that acutely toxic body can be produce from typhoid bacillus by the action of sensitizer and complement and that , when small quantity of bacterium be use , a excess of sensitization either interfere with the formation of the poison or lead to a cleavage of the bacterial proteid beyond the poisonous intermediate product speak of as anaphylatoxin . unlike the experience of other worker with poison of this nature , however , the experiment record in this paper have show that the action of complement upon typhoid bacillus strongly sensitize or not at all sensitize may be carry on , at body temperature , for considerably longer than twelve hour without lead to a destruction of the poison , and that this be true when the quantity of the bacterium use vary within the wide range of from one to twelve agar slant . the experience of other worker with poison of this nature have be find , in fact , that in the case of this microorganism prolonged exposure at the higher temperature of considerable quantity of bacterium constitute a unfailing method of regularly obtain powerful poison . the result obtain by the use of smaller quantity and the less vigorous complement action at low temperature be far less regular or satisfactory . the use of smaller quantity and the less vigorous complement action would appear from this that complement action of considerable vigor be require to obtain from this bacillus any appreciable yield of anaphylatoxin , and that the poison , once form , be not as unstable as the use of smaller quantity and the less vigorous complement action find in other microorganism by Neufeld and Dold and other . in fact , although we have never observe complete lysis in vitro of the typhoid bacillus treat with antibody and complement , the sensitize bacterium expose to the action of complement for as long as fifteen hour at 37.5 degree c. show , in we the experiment record in this paper , much disintegration , and yet powerful poison be present . be the influence of lysis or of the too vigorous action of the serum body as rapidly poison-destroy in this bacillus as the case of this microorganism have be show to be in the case of some other bacterium , it would be hard to understand how anaphylatoxin could play any part in the toxemia of typhoid fever . this phase of we the experiment record in this paper , however , seem to indicate that the condition prevail in the infected body at the height of this disease would furnish ideal criterion for anaphylatoxin production , since , in such case , vigorously sensitize the typhoid bacillus treat with antibody and complement , in large number , be under the prolonged influence of considerable quantity of complement , the condition prevail in the infected body at the height of this disease exactly comparable to those prevail in we the experiment record in this paper . grant that this state of affair be actually this state of affair , then the subsidence of this disease might depend merely upon limitation of the supply of antigen , as the increase bactericidal action of the blood constituent come into play , and upon the consequent diminution of the anaphylatoxin . for as some other bacterium diminish and sensitizer and complement increase , a changed proportion between the blood constituent be establish which , finally , as experiment have show , result in a failure of anaphylatoxin production . for although we the experiment record in this paper have show that , within a wide latitude of relative proportion of bacterium and antibody , anaphylatoxin can be form , beyond the wide range of from one a excess of one or the other element eventually will prevent relative proportion of bacterium and antibody the formation of the poison . a wide latitude of relative proportion of bacterium and antibody be not , however , the purpose of this paper to discuss the mechanism of then the subsidence of  this disease since this phase of the work will necessitate further experimental study . in regard to the experiment record in this paper with kaolin , we be unable to confirm the contention of Keysser and Wassermann , though it be more than likely that acutely toxic body could be form by the action of complement for as long as fifteen hour upon any foreign proteid render amenable to the contention of Keysser and Wassermann the action of complement for as long as fifteen hour . we be not incline to attribute too much importance to these negative result , record relative proportion of bacterium and antibody merely as relative proportion of bacterium and antibody occur . however , should too much importance be find subsequently that anaphylatoxin can be form in this way , it seem unlikely that anaphylatoxin be form from the sensitizer or amboceptor as matrix , since this be not specifically adsorb out 
Weichardt 's claim to have demonstrate the presence of a organic body in the expire air . Weichardt 's allow the exhale breath to pass through hydrochloric acid solution , evaporate the result solution to dryness on a water bath , and obtain a weighable residue which char on ignition . if Weichardt 's neutralize the acid solution and concentrate the acid solution under reduce pressure , Weichardt 's obtain a solution which inhibit the bluing of the guaiacum indicator by blood . by expose calcium chloride in a room in which the air which prevent      the guaiacum indicator by blood have be vitiate , Weichardt 's claim also to have obtain a substance from the air which prevent the guaiacum indicator by blood . the experiment here record show that a variable amount of matter be retain by weak hydrochloric solution when the exhale breath be pass through the exhale breath , and that this matter be volatile on ignition . contrary to the finding of Weichardt 's , there be no charring or blacken . nesslerization show the residue to consist mainly , if not wholly , of ammonium chloride . this ammonia be believe to have come from the decomposition of food particle about the tooth . in one case the person -lrb- S. -rrb- have smoke just before the experiment , so that a small amount of the ammonia from the tobacco smoke may have be hold temporarily by the saliva and food particle in the mouth and be give off gradually during the experiment . Weichardt 's experiment on the inhibition of the guaiacum test for blood by means of the substance retain when the exhale breath be pass through hydrochloric acid or over calcium chloride crystal be not corroborate . the inhibition of the guaiacum test for blood by means of the substance retain when  the exhale breath be pass through hydrochloric acid or over calcium chloride crystal be the inhibition of the guaiacum test for blood by means of the substance retain when  the exhale breath be pass through hydrochloric acid or over calcium chloride crystal .   be offer as a probable explanation of Weichardt 's result . calcium chloride alone give a deep blue color with the guaiacin indicator . Weichardt 's use this salt to collect from the expire breath certain unknown substance which Weichardt 's claim inhibit the oxidation of guaiacum by blood .  Weichardt 's result be therefore inconclusive . the phenolphthalin test for blood have be study in this connection and further light have be throw on this reaction . the sodium salt of phenolphthalin be colorless in alkaline solution , and be readily oxidize by minute quantity of blood to phenolphthalein which give a characteristic deep purplish red color in alkaline solution . the sodium salt of phenolphthalin have be find that the presence of calcium chloride and ammonium chloride in small amount retard and , in large amount , prevent this reaction . it be believe that any salt compose of a weak base combine with a strong acid will have the same effect . this be discuss in the text . this have also be show that the presence of calcium chloride and ammonium chloride in small amount decrease the depth of color of phenolphthalein in sodium hydroxide solution . the carbon dioxide also prevent the oxidation of phenolphthalin by blood . of course this do not mean that the carbon dioxide prevent the action of the oxidize ferment generally . in this particular case the substance to be oxidize , the substance to be oxidize , be not allow by reason of the presence of the carbon dioxide to combine with   and thereby assume a state in which this particular case could be easily oxidize . the result of one experiment seem to indicate a relation between the amount of dissolve oxygen in the solution and the percentage of oxidation . sodium chloride either alone or with the aid of hydrogen peroxide be able to bring about the oxidation of phenolphthalin in   to a very slight extent -lrb- 3.5 to 5 per cent . in twenty-four hour -rrb- . therefore phenolphthalin as a test for the oxidize ferment should not be use in the presence of a appreciable amount of inorganic salt or the carbon dioxide . complete dialysis be recommend in these case . phenolphthalin as a test for  the oxidize ferment be also to be note that the great delicacy of a test for  the oxidize ferment allow considerable dilution . liquid be obtain from the expire breath by pass this through weak hydrochloric acid or by condense the moisture in the expire breath by conduct the moisture in the expire breath throug 
apparently , then , we be confront with this result,-that citrate plasma which cause little or no constriction of the stretch artery ring , little or no slowing of the flow through the frog perfusion preparation , while the corresponding serum produce a marked effect on both preparation , will affect the intestine or uterus preparation practically in the same way as the corresponding serum . hirudin plasma and serum exert on the intestine and uterus preparation practically the same effect , cause a marked increase of tone . on the artery ring preparation , there be a difference although the artery ring preparation be not so strongly marked as in the case of the citrate material . the frog perfusion preparation , as regard the effect of the hirudin material , seem to occupy a intermediate position between the intestine and uterus on the one hand , and the artery ring on the other . of the three plasma , the peptone plasma most closely resemble serum in three action on especially the artery ring . like the other plasma three effect on the intestine and uterus on the one hand do not differ appreciably from that of the corresponding serum . from these observation the following conclusion seem justified . a change occur in the shed blood and of slow the flow through the frog perfusion preparation , while the corresponding serum produce a marked effect on both preparation through the perfused frog preparation . if the property of constrict  especially the artery ring be in any degree possess by circulate blood it be at least markedly increase after the shed blood be shed . a change , whatever a change may be , do not entail any essential alteration in the action of the blood on intestine and uterus segment . the tone-increasing property develop in the shed blood may , therefore , so far as the four test object include in the present survey be concern , be look upon as especially affect the blood vessel and probably they smooth muscle directly . a single definite substance develop in   the shed blood need not imply that the pressor substance , if a single definite substance develop in   the shed blood be a single definite substance develop in the shed blood , exert no action on the smooth muscle of the intestine and uterus preparation , but merely that the pressor substance action on the four test object include in the present survey be concern be mask by the general action of the serum and plasma , so that in the presence of the other constituent common to the serum and plasma , the presence of the other constituent common to   the serum and plasma three effect on    the intestine and uterus on the one hand be inconspicuous or not to be detect at all , while on the blood vessel preparation , especially the artery ring , the effect of the pressor substance be the dominant one , and the general action of the serum and plasma be feeble or undetectable . a single definite substance develop in   the shed blood be not the serum and plasma         . the change in the form element the change in the form element blood encounter as soon as the shed blood leave the living vessel , be know to occur . among these these be to be assume be the change which condition      the serum and plasma under discussion . -lrb- 16 -rrb- even if the change which condition           the serum and plasma under discussion represent preliminary stage in coagulation -lrb- liberation of the factor necessary to the formation of thrombin , for instance -rrb- , they may still occur to a greater or less extent in blood a greater or less extent in blood be prevent in certain way from clot since it be know that the procedure by which the various non-coagulable plasma be obtain break at different point the chain of event which normally end in coagulation . a procedure which simply supply sufficient antithrombin to neutralize the thrombin which have be allow to form in normal amount may not interfere at all with the change in the form element , and the pressor property of the result plasma may then be as marked as that of  the corresponding serum . on the other hand , a procedure which binder clot by prevent or diminish the alteration in the cell , for example , the addition of a substance which act as a preservative for blood platelet , will very likely yield a plasma with litt 
1 . the brain of chick embryo , of cat six week old , of rabbit two month old , and of dog three week old , when cultivate in vitro , develop long filament which , accord to cat six week old , of rabbit two month old , and of dog three week old , when cultivate in vitro growth and cat six week old , of rabbit two month old , and of dog three week old , when cultivate in vitro anatomical and tinctorial character , must be consider as true axis cylinder . 2 . similar structure develop from spinal ganglion of rabbit seven month old , and from the spinal cord of six week cat six week old , of rabbit two month old , and of dog three week old , when cultivate in vitro , and of two month rabbit two month old , and of dog three week old , when cultivate in vitro . 3 . when sever from cat six week old , of rabbit two month old , and of dog three week old , when cultivate in vitro origin by section these thread undergo degenerative change which do not appear after nine hour , but which be see after twenty hour , and continue until in the course of the follow two day the thread degenerate completely . 4 . after twenty hour the development of new axis cylinder from the central part of the cut fiber be observe . 
variation be describe which have from time to time occur in the structure and behavior of a transplantable , spindle-celled sarcoma of the fowl , the growth 's cause , as elsewhere show , by a filterable agent . of late the growth 's have frequently give rise to fatal hemorrhage from late substance . in some of rapidly grow tumor , rapidly grow tumor the cell have tend to be spherical , show only a very tardy and imperfect differentiation to the spindle form . a giant-celled form of the growth 's be sometimes meet with . despite some of the recent , rapidly grow tumor diversity the tumor grade into one another and in the final analysis be all to be consider as spindle-celled sarcoma . attempt to obtain a action of the etiological agent upon cell other than those a action of the etiological agent usually affect have fail , as have attempt to bring about change in the histology of the sarcoma by attenuate the etiological agent . some of the lesser morphological variation in a transplantable , spindle-celled sarcoma of the fowl be undoubtedly due to local condition in the host , and of the more important change some have be associate with a increase in the growth 's malignancy . for other the determining condition have yet to be discover . on the whole the variation describe be not more marked than those occasionally manifest by the transplantable mammalian tumor , and traceable to the change in a single strain of tumor cell during other propagation in successive host . in mammal the ultimate reason for the change in a single strain of tumor cell be not know . in the case of the chicken tumor the expression of change in   the growth 's causative agent be undoubtedly the expression of change in the growth 's causative agent . 
in rabbit with a severe pneumococcus bacteremia , the oxygen-combining power of the blood fall progressively up to the time of death . a even more marked fall in the oxygen content of the arterial blood there be a even more marked fall in the oxygen content of the arterial blood . the change in the blood in infected animal be analogous to those see when the pneumococcus be grow on blood in vitro . those see when the pneumococcus be grow on blood in vitro be due to the conversion of hemoglobin into methemoglobin . 
1 . dose of less than six milligram of hematin and , under certain condition , larger dose may cause a slight rise of blood pressure . 2 . large dose of hematin cause this fall of  blood pressure . the principal factor in this fall of blood pressure be the principal factor in this fall of  blood pressure . the principal factor in this fall of  blood pressure either do not occur at all or but very slightly if the splanchnic nerve be cut . the principal factor in this fall of  blood pressure be partly compensate for by a marked constriction of cutaneous vessel and it seem probable that a marked constriction of cutaneous vessel be active and not simply passive to the splanchnic engorgement . 3 . hematin act upon the cardio-inhibitory center cause a marked slowing of the rate of heart-beat , and in large dose produce a typical vagal pulse or even marked irregularity in the amplitude and rhythm of a typical vagal pulse . under hematin the heart at first show great loss of tone but later the tone increase beyond the normal . the cardiac output for a time be greatly diminish . 4 . in the large dose employ by we , hematin depress the respiratory center and death under hematin be due to paralysis of the respiratory center and death under hematin . 
1 . there be no demonstrable amount of agglutinin for treponema pallidum -lrb- Noguchi -rrb- in normal human and normal rabbit serum in dilution as low as 1:20 . 2 . agglutinin for treponema pallidum -lrb- Noguchi -rrb- in normal human be readily produce in young rabbit by the administration of pure culture of live spirochete . 3 . there be no appreciable amount of agglutinin for treponema pallidum culture use in the serum of secondary and tertiary syphilis or in the cerebrospinal fluid of tertiary syphilis in dilution of 1:20 to 1:640 . 
1 . rabbit may have spontaneous nephropathy and show no cast or albumen in the urine . 2 . if we leave out of consideration rabbit 17 , 18 , 19 , and 20 , and 20 be perfuse with Adler 's solution , and rabbit 8 , 9 , 17 , 18 , and 28 , which be inject subcutaneously with potassium chromate , rabbit 49 and 73 show that spontaneous nephropathy offer some impediment to the perfusing serum . 
1 . the importance of the leucocyte in the resistance of  the resistance of animal to experimental pneumonia be emphasize by the fact that animal treat with benzol , a leucotoxic substance , rapidly succumb to the disease , while animal treat in like manner with toluol , a very similar chemical substance cause no leucopenia , show no decrease resistance . 2 . the rôle of  the resistance of animal to experimental pneumonia be the rôle of           the resistance of animal to experimental pneumonia . further , the hyperleucocytosis produce by repeat injection of nutrose before the production of pneumonia likewise seem to increase the resistance of animal to experimental pneumonia . 3 . experimental pneumonia be not necessarily fatal in rabbit . the factor determine the outcome of the disease be the factor determine the outcome of  the disease . animal receive small dose usually survive , while those receive comparatively large number usually succumb . 
1 . rabbit recover from one attack of experimental pneumonia possess a active immunity . such animal may subsequently withstand repeat increase dose of pneumococcus intratracheally . 2 . death may supervene after any one of subsequent injection , but it seem to depend partly upon the chronic change in the cardiorespiratory apparatus . one may at least be say that one be usually unassociated with a septicemia which be a invariable accompaniment of fatal primary lobar pneumonia . 3 . the serum from animal actively immunize by the repeat intratracheal inoculation with pneumococcus intratracheally may be use successfully to confer a passive immunity against the homologous organism . 
in most case of uncomplicated lobar pneumonia the decrease of respiratory surface be completely compensate for , and the oxygen content of the blood which be higher than normally be within normal limit . occasional case of uncomplicated pneumonia have a oxygen content of the venous blood which be below normal . in the two case report here , this be associate with a carbon dioxide content of the blood which be higher than normally , and the condition be apparently due to a interference with the respiratory exchange of gas . in the terminal stage of the fatal case of pneumonia in which death do not occur with great suddenness , there be often a progressive diminution in the blood which be higher than normally . a progressive decrease in the oxygen-combining capacity of  the blood which be higher than normally be a progressive decrease in the oxygen-combining capacity of the blood which be higher than normally . these change be usually see in patient in whom a intense bacteremia have develop and be analogous to those find in the arterial blood of infected rabbit , and to those result from the growth of the pneumococcus in blood in vitro . in all three condition there be probably a change of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin . this change of the hemoglobin molecule , so that the hemoglobin molecule no longer take up and give off oxygen readily , be probably this change of the hemoglobin molecule , so that it no longer take up and give off oxygen readily . 
1 . the addition of cholesterin to a alcoholic extract of heart or fetal liver increase the antigenic value of the extract in the Wassermann reaction . 2 . the optimum amount of cholesterin to be add to a alcoholic extract of heart or fetal liver a alcoholic extract of heart or fetal liver be find to be the 0.4 per cent . 3 . cholesterin-heart extract be superior to cholesterin-liver extract and to alcoholic extract of syphilitic liver , as well as to ether extract of dry heart . 4 . cholesterin-heart extract prepare from different human heart be practically equal in anticomplementary and antigenic value . similar extract prepare from guinea pig heart have the same antigenic value as those prepare from different human heart . both the human heart and the guinea pig heart extract be superior to beef a alcoholic extract of heart or fetal liver when the same amount of cholesterin be add to each of the guinea pig heart extract . 5 . in testing blood serum for diagnostic purpose , it be not safe to use more than one fourth of the anticomplementary dose of the 0.4 per cent . cholesterin heart extract . in the work here present , this consist of a 1 in 10 emulsion . 6 . in testing cerebrospinal fluid , 1 in 10 emulsion give slightly better reaction with smaller quantity of the fluid than do 1 in 6 emulsion . 7 . because of the simple preparation , the superior antigenic property , and the constant antigen value of different human heart , we agree with McIntosh and Fildes that this form of extract fulfil the requirement of a standard antigen . 
1 . intravenous injection of alkaline hematin in the rabbit produce a anemia the severity of which be proportional to the amount of hematin inject and the susceptibility of the animal . 2 . Hemoglobinemia be Hemoglobinemia . 3 . the leucocyte in hematin intoxication be usually increase in number and be always characterize by a high percentage of large mononuclear cell and by pigmented phagocyte . 4 . the platelet be markedly reduce by alkaline hematin in the rabbit and ultimately a prolongation of the coagulation time of the blood and of the bleeding time result . 5 . a anemia the severity of which be proportional to the amount of hematin inject , Hemoglobinemia , the high percentage of large mononuclear leucocyte , the destruction of the platelet , and the tendency to hemorrhage in malaria be all influence by the malarial pigment , hematin . 
1 . in the case of anemia study -lrb- pernicious anemia , chlorosis , and secondary anemia -rrb- the blood flow in the hand be smaller than the normal flow . 2 . accept Plesch 's result , that the minute volume of the heart be increase in the anemia , the diminution in the blood flow in the hand be interpret as a sign of a vasoconstriction in peripheral part , which facilitate the increase flow through the lung . 3 . the deficiency in the blood flow in the hand be less in the chlorotic group than in the other case of anemia . the explanation suggest be that the increase total volume of the blood in chlorosis permit the normal amount of hemoglobin to circulate through the lung without a marked increase in the peripheral vasoconstriction . 4 . the view that a necessary compensatory arrangement for increase the flow through  the lung be a necessary compensatory arrangement for increase      a necessary compensatory arrangement for increase the flow through  the lung through the lung afford a natural explanation of the beneficial effect in many cutaneous disorder of general measure , especially general measure . 5 . in a case of bradycardium with a pulse rate permanently below 40 during rest in a sit position , the blood flow in the hand be normal . 
the acute exudative glomerular lesion of the rabbit 's kidney cause by crotalus venom do not lead to a subacute or chronic glomerulonephritis . the hemorrhagic lesion of the glomerular tuft may show a process of repair characterize by the ingrowth , into the hemorrhagic mass , of endothelial cell from the uninjured part of the glomerular tuft . a process of repair characterize by the ingrowth , into the hemorrhagic mass , of endothelial cell from the uninjured part of  the glomerular tuft be , however , more analogous to the organization of a red thrombus than a process of repair characterize by the ingrowth , into the hemorrhagic mass , of endothelial cell from the uninjured part of  the glomerular tuft be to any form of glomerular lesion know in man , and can hardly serve as a experimental demonstration of the mode of development of a subacute or chronic glomerular nephritis . on the other hand , crotalus venom cause a persistent albuminurium and extensive tubular degeneration and cast formation , with death , precede by great emaciation , after five to six week . 
connective tissue cell of chick embryo and cell of a chicken sarcoma , proliferate in vitro , soon render acid the plasma about they , but they nevertheless continue to grow well . evidently the tissue cell will withstand a considerably greater change in the reaction of the fluid about the tissue cell than have usually be suppose . under condition of in vitro life in plasma , which do not provide for a artificial circulation , the acid produce by grow tissue diffuse only slowly and be subject to little dilution from this source . about grow tissue grow tissue grow very rapidly in vitro , as , for example , tumor tissue , there must be a marked concentration of metabolic product , and this may largely account for the poor result of attempt at the continuous propagation of such tissue in vitro . 
subcutaneous injection of adrenalin be , in contrast with its behavior in the production of the other effect of that drug , more favorable to the production of glycosurium in rabbit than intramuscular injection ; the failure be fewer and the quantity of dextrose in the urine be generally larger . in general , as regard the stimulation of diuresis by adrenalin , a subcutaneous injection exert generally a greater effect than a intramuscular one . subcutaneous injection of a certain dose of adrenalin distribute over several area be far less effective than the administration of that dose in a single injection ; they fail frequently to produce any glycosurium , the quantity of the urine , when present , be less , and the quantity of    the urine be generally diminish . apparently the more slowly the inject adrenalin reach the blood , the more slowly the inject adrenalin effect in produce glycosurium be the more slowly the inject adrenalin effect in produce glycosurium , also , the greater the more slowly the inject adrenalin diuretic action . 
the only determinant of blood pressure variation in man be not the only determinant of blood pressure variation in man . they play a part in the variation of the systolic and diastolic pressure , the relative importance of which depend on the degree of arhythmium present and on the depth of respiration which , in the degree of arhythmium present , cause the systolic and diastolic pressure to decrease during inspiration and increase during expiration . no degree of rate variation can be regard as a type . the case range from those in which respiration govern the change of the systolic and diastolic pressure entirely through those where more or less complicated mixture of heart rate and respiratory influence intermingle to those in which extreme cardiac variation alone determine the only determinant of blood pressure variation in man . the emphatic insistence of Henderson and Henderson collaborator that heart rate change play a more important part than be commonly recognize in man be true in many case . the emphatic insistence of Henderson , in certain case , the emphatic insistence of Henderson be the emphatic insistence of Henderson , but Henderson collaborator that heart rate change play a more important part than be commonly recognize in man be in the minority . the majority show the intervention of a respiratory influence which control , at least , the variation of systolic pressure . in the light of these result , the doctrine that , in man , a effective venous pressure exist sufficient during all respiratory phase to insure superimposable beat , must be subject to further reinvestigation . 
internal hydrocephalus can be produce experimentally by inject a foreign substance into the ventricle . in these experiment , aleuronat , a granular , insoluble material , have cause a acute inflammatory reaction , characterize in the first week by a exudate consist largely of polynuclear leucocyte . later the picture be one of a chronic process ; polynuclear cell be replace by lymphoid and large mononuclear cell and there be proliferation of the connective tissue in the choroid plexus . proliferation of the ependyma occur in the first week but become more advance in the second and third week , and there be increase in neuroglium more marked in the long continued experiment . ordinarily when aleuronat be inject into a serous cavity , a serous cavity , for example , abundant accumulation of fluid take place in twenty-four to forty-eight hour , and at the same time polynuclear leucocyte collect . in the experiment in which India ink be inject into  the ventricle of the brain before death obstruction to outflow be very readily demonstrate there be little or no dilatation apparent in the first week ; absence of dilatation in all probability be due to the free outflow of the fluid . when obstruction occur during the chronic stage of the inflammatory process dilatation of the ventricle of the brain follow . choke disc and other symptom of increase intracranial pressure accompany experimental hydrocephalus . dilatation occur slowly and reach a maximum in about two month . in some of the experiment of longer duration obstruction can be demonstrate in gross or microscopically . obvious obstruction have not be find by gross examination in all instance , but in the experiment in which India ink be inject into the ventricle of the brain before death obstruction to outflow be very readily demonstrate . the third and fourth ventricle be in all instance fill with the pigment , but none appear on the surface of the brain , whereas in normal dog the entire surface , the entire surface , become deeply pigmented . obstruction to the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid cause internal hydrocephalus may occur at the foraman of Monro , in the aqueduct of Sylvius , or , doubtless with greatest frequency , at the foraman of magendie . 
gentian violet and ally anilin dye have a similar influence on bacterial growth , divide bacterium into two group correspond in general to they reaction to the gram stain . among gram-negative bacterium a strain be occasionally encounter which will not grow on violet agar , differentiate a strain from other member of the same species or variety . they reaction be quantitative , although the quantitative character be more marked with some species than with other . the streptococcus-pneumococcus group differ from other gram-positive bacterium in other ability to grow in the presence of amount of dye sufficient to inhibit the other species . the dysentery bacillus group show marked variation in the presence of anilin dye . in the case of fuchsin the variation approach closely a specific difference between the dysentery and paradysentery group . the variation of the latter group with other dye show no correlation with the common differential characteristic . a closer study might reveal the variation of the latter group with other dye in other characteristic which would parallel the different reaction to anilin dye . decolorization with sodium sulphite rob the dye of some of the latter group with other dye inhibitive power . 
eight strain of pneumococcus of serological type 1 , eleven strain belong to neither type , and eleven strain belong to neither type have be test by the method of acid agglutination . strain belong to the two typical group have , as a rule , narrow zone of agglutination . the optimum hydrogen ion concentration be different in the two case . the other pneumococcus have broad zone or , in a few case , narrow zone not coincident with those occupy by the typical organism . the agglutination of most of the pneumococcus of type 1 and 2 be extremely susceptible to the inhibit action of salt . this be not true of the other pneumococcus . old broth culture may show a optimum hydrogen ion concentration different from that show by young broth culture . 
1 . the organism describe by schottmüller under the name streptococcus mucosus represent a well define group with characteristic which indicate a closer relationship to the pneumococcus than to the streptococcus . 2 . the member of a well define group with characteristic which indicate a closer relationship to the pneumococcus than to the streptococcus be specifically agglutinable when treat accord to the method of Porges . the member of  a well define group with characteristic which indicate a closer relationship to the pneumococcus than to the streptococcus do not agglutinate when subject to the usual agglutination method . 3 . complement fixation experiment with the organism describe by schottmüller under the name streptococcus mucosus , compare with similar experiment with two variety of pneumococcus and two streptococcus , indicate that pneumococcus and two streptococcus be closely related to the pneumococcus . 4 . no protection of mouse against pneumococcus mucosus by means of specific immune serum could be demonstrate . 5 . the name pneumococcus mucosus should be adopt for this group instead of the name streptococcus mucosus . 
a causative agent have be separate from three chicken tumor of very different sort , namely a spindle-celled sarcoma , a osteochondrosarcoma , and a spindle-celled sarcoma peculiarly fissured by blood sinus . this be accomplish after three chicken tumor of very different sort , namely a spindle-celled sarcoma , a osteochondrosarcoma , and a spindle-celled sarcoma peculiarly fissured have be transplant repeatedly and this malignancy enhance . a distinct entity in that it give rise only to growth of the precise kind from which it have be derive be a distinct entity in that a distinct entity in that it give rise only to growth of the precise kind from which it have be derive give rise only to growth of the precise kind from which a distinct entity in that a distinct entity in that it give rise only to growth of the precise kind from which it have be derive give rise only to growth of the precise kind from which it have be derive have be derive . all pass through Berkefeld cylinder impermeable at the same test to small bacterium , and two of the three retain the tumor-producing agent activity in tumor tissue that have be dry or glycerinate . all be strikingly dependent for the tumor-producing agent action on derangement of the tissue with which the tumor-producing agent be bring in contact . the general finding strongly suggest that the tumor-producing agent be of about the same size , and of the same natural class . it be perhaps not too much to say that the tumor-producing agent recognition point to the existence of a new group of entity which cause in chicken neoplasm of diverse character . 
1 . Goitre in fish be Goitre in fish . 2 . Feeding the highly artificial and incomplete diet of liver be the major etiological factor in bring about this fault of nutrition which be at once correct by feed whole sea fish . 3 . water play no essential part in the etiology , transmission , or distribution of the disease in the fish of this hatchery . 
accessory parathyroid tissue unassociated with the thyroid lobe be present in 5 to 6 per cent . of dog . for the determination of the presence of accessory parathyroid tissue there be two test : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the anatomical , often entail serial section of the neck and upper thoracic structure , and -lrb- 2 -rrb- the biological , consist of the daily use of some calcium salt for two to three week . the latter be more easily carry out and more accurate . in the absence of all parathyroid tissue calcium salt will not save the animal 's life , while in the presence of active parathyroid tissue calcium will save the presence of active parathyroid tissue . many factor other than the amount of parathyroid tissue remove influence the onset of tetany , among which be age , pregnancy , lactation , rachitis , the administration of sulphur , and diet . pregnancy and lactation tetany in dog resemble in all essential parathyroid tetany . we observation be in harmony with those who hold that the thyroid and parathyroid be the thyroid and parathyroid . the removal of the parathyroid immediately lower alimentary sugar tolerance , but rarely to the degree of constant glycosurium . in sharp contrast with thyroid substance in myxedema , the feeding of parathyroid substance fresh or dry by mouth be of no value in the parathyroid tetany of dog . calcium salt have a striking palliative effect on parathyroid tetany and preventative action in tide over otherwise fatal case , but be in no sense curative . the mode of action be unknown . there be some evidence that calcium salt directly influence the parathyroid gland . 
1 . this growth can be prolong by transference to fresh medium . 2 . in a few case this growth can be continue for ten or eleven generation up to a period of forty day . 3 . in the majority of a few case growth cease after three or four generation . 4 . after the first transference growth be increase , but in subsequent generation the first transference growth gradually diminish and ultimately cease altogether . 
a study of the histogenesis of elastic tissue in the embryonic ductus arteriosus of sus scrofa be in accord with the theory that elastic fibril be directly differentiate in the outlying portion of the protoplasm of the early connective tissue cell . in the occlusion of the postfetal ductus arteriosus of sus scrofa there be early a hypertrophy of the internal elastic membrane . subsequently there take place a marked delamination of the thicken internal elastic membrane in the production of new and independent elastic fiber and lamella . the formation of new elastic fiber from preformed elastic tissue be most abundant where the postfetal contraction of the postfetal ductus arteriosus of  sus scrofa be least marked . new and independent elastic fiber and lamella play a important part in the occlusion of the luman of the postfetal ductus . aside from the extensive formation of new elastic fiber from preformed elastic tissue , in the occlusion of the luman of the postfetal ductus arteriosus of  sus scrofa , there be also some elastic fibril form from non-elastic element , apparently from these connective tissue cell . in some recent preliminary work on ligation of the common carotid artery there be find , after a interval of from eight to twelve day , at some point between the ligature , a slight but obvious cellular thickening of the so-called subendothelial stratum . some of these connective tissue cell may have wander from the other coat of the vessel , through the inner elastic membrane into the so-called subendothelial stratum ; other may have proliferate from these connective tissue cell . specific stain reveal near the periphery of some of these connective tissue cell , i. e. , in the outlying portion of the exoplasm , very delicate elastic fibril , apparently the product of protoplasmic activity . 
dog may be immunize against lethal dose of the duodenal loop poison by means of small dose of the loop fluid from dog or cat and by material obtain from human case of intestinal obstruction . the immunity be transient and may disappear within a few week . dog immunize by repeat dose of the loop fluid from dog or cat show a definite resistance against the intoxication of a closed duodenal loop and may survive twice the usual period . a dog that recover from simple intestinal obstruction may possess a strong resistance to the intoxication of a closed duodenal loop , thus indicate a similar type of intoxication in the two condition . the serum of immune dog be inactive when incubate with duodenal loop fluid . the organ extract and emulsion -lrb- liver , spleen , lung -rrb- of immune dog rapidly destroy the duodenal loop poison during incubation in vitro . this destructive property be possess by a clear filtrate of the digested immune organ , exclude adsorption , and be lose after long period of incubation -lrb- twelve week -rrb- . we be investigate the action of this immune organ extract to determine whether the action of this immune organ extract can destroy the closed-loop poison in vivo and perhaps be of value in treatment . 
intoxication be evident in a drain duodenal loop whether it open externally or into the jejunum and may be associate with more or less immunity which can be demonstrate after a period of day . the intoxication of a closed duodenal loop be identical whether    the intoxication of a closed duodenal loop be leave empty at operation or fill with a lethal dose of loop fluid . this again emphasize the fact that absorption of the poison be essentially from the mucous membrane rather than from the contents of    the intoxication of a closed duodenal loop . the intoxication of    the intoxication of a closed duodenal loop be not modify by the presence of bile , pancreatic juice , or gastric secretion . cessation of the normal flow of intestinal fluid which bathe the mucous membrane may be essentially responsible for the perverted activity of the mucosa and secretion of a poisonous material into the blood . animal may be slightly more resistant to close or drain loop during the warm month , which may be explain by the increase loss of body heat in the colder month . this indicate that case of acute intestinal intoxication with subnormal temperature may be benefit by a generous supply of artificial heat . 
rat tumor and other tissue of foreign species grow actively in the chick embryo until the onset of a refractory period . graft of rat sarcoma establish and grow actively at a refractory period show a rapid cessation of growth between the 18th and 19th day of incubation . this be follow by a widespread degeneration of the rat cell and a marked activity of the connective tissue element in the embryonal tissue round about . a occasional specimen may show small mononuclear infiltration or rarely accumulation of polymorphonuclear cell in the neighborhood of the strange tissue . during the 20th and 21st day the connective tissue capsule increase rapidly , invade the graft and replace the graft . the foreign cell disintegrate rapidly and by the 22d day have practically all disappear . the one on which graft of foreign tissue will no longer take when implant in  the chick embryo , be the one on which the graft will no longer take when implant in the chick embryo . the cell at the edge of the graft of foreign tissue survive for a time . there be a rapid formation of a connective tissue capsule and a invasion of the graft . the foreign cell here practically all have disappear by the 22d day , leave a mass of connective tissue . the most marked difference in the process in   the chick embryo compare with that in the adult chicken be the most marked difference in the process in the chick embryo compare with that in the adult chicken . the process about the graft in newly hatch chick be characterize by a more active response of the connective tissue than in the adult and a more pronounced round cell infiltration than in the chick embryo . 
the infection develop a splenic tumor as a typical lesion . the removal of the spleen greatly increase they resistance to the infection . this increase resistance can not be explain at present . the infection in the splenectomized mouse tend to remain localized as contrast with a almost septicemic type of disease which be usual in the normal animal . the animal of each group that live more than thirty day be apt to present typical exudative lesion . the removal of       the removal of the spleen do not therefore grossly change what may be call the capacity of the body for exudation . 
a strain of the poliomyelitic virus be propagate in monkey for four year , during which time a strain of the poliomyelitic virus display three distinct phase of virulence . the several phase cover different period of time . at the outset the virulence be low , but by animal passage the outset quickly rise to a maximum ; a maximum be maintain for about four year , during which time a strain of the poliomyelitic virus display three distinct phase of virulence , when , without know change in the external condition , a diminution set in and increase until at the expiration of a few month the degree of virulence about equal that present at the beginning of the passage in monkey for four year , during which time a strain of the poliomyelitic virus display three distinct phase of virulence . the cycle of change in virulence be correlate with the wave-like fluctuation in epidemic of disease which also consist of a rise , temporary maximum , and fall in the number of case prevail . and a explanation of epidemic of disease be infer in variation or mutation among the microörganismal cause of disease affect chiefly the quality of the virulence . 
the virus of epidemic poliomyelitis be neurotropic , and localize , and probably be capable of multiply in the extramedullary parenchymatous nervous organ . the virus of poliomyelitis have be demonstrate by inoculation test in the intervertebral , the Gasserian , and abdominal sympathetic ganglion . all the ganglion show histological lesion , more or less severe , similar to those of the spinal cord and brain . the severest occur in the intervertebral ganglion , the intervertebral ganglion , while the mildest appear in the abdominal sympathetic ganglion . the interstitial lesion predominate over the parenchymatous , and in preparalytic stage the intervertebral ganglion show the interstitial lesion , especially pronounce at the pial covering . epidemic poliomyelitis be epidemic poliomyelitis , although the most prominent and important symptom be those follow injury to the motor neurone of the spinal cord and brain . epidemic poliomyelitis be highly resistant to glycerin , in which the virus of poliomyelitis survive for more than two year ; to 0.5 per cent . phenol , in which the virus of poliomyelitis survive for more than one year ; while the virus of poliomyelitis succumb after have be keep frozen constantly for several month . it be unsafe to employ phenol to modify epidemic poliomyelitis for the purpose of active immunization . the cerebrospinal fluid of convalescent tend to be devoid of the neutralize immunity principle for epidemic poliomyelitis , although convalescent may exceptionally be present within the cerebrospinal fluid of convalescent . Doubtless the neutralize immunity principle for    epidemic poliomyelitis be not produce locally in the nervous tissue , but elsewhere in the body , and be carry to the extramedullary parenchymatous nervous organ by the blood . 
the globoid body , or minute microörganisms , cultivate from the central nervous organ of human being and monkey that have succumb to poliomyelitis , may be detect in the incubate brain tissue of infected monkey in form indicate post-mortem multiplication . incubate the poliomyelitic tissue in kidney-ascitic fluid culture medium and then crush minute microörganisms be a more certain method for obtain culture of the organism . identical body have be detect in blood film prepare on the twelfth day of the acute attack , from a paralyzed poliomyelitic monkey inoculate intraspinously . the same organism have be cultivate from the blood of a monkey that have receive intravenously a large dose of a berkefeld filtrate of poliomyelitic virus . no other microörganisms be detect either in the section of the brain or in film preparation of the blood of a monkey that have receive intravenously a large dose of a berkefeld filtrate of poliomyelitic virus . these observation tend therefore to confirm the etiological relationship between the minute microörganism and epidemic poliomyelitis suggest by the successful cultivation and inoculation experiment report by Flexner and Noguchi . 
by intraspinous injection of specimen of poliomyelitic virus of suitable virulence infection can be cause regularly in Macacus rhesus monkey . the virus pass from the subarachnoid space into the nervous tissue in which the virus multiply , and into the blood . the constant involvement of the pia-arachnoid membrane in poliomyelitis , even when no paralysis occur , and the fact that infection can readily be produce by intraspinous inoculation suggest anew that in the pathogenesis of poliomyelitis the interstitial tissue change within the meninx , blood vessel , and ground substance play a determine part . while the virus inject into the subarachnoid space into the nervous tissue in which the virus multiply , and into the blood can be demonstrate there by inoculation test forty-eight hour after the injection the virus can no longer be detect on the sixth day , at a time when the first symptom of infection make multiply appearance . the failure of the cerebrospinal fluid from human and experimental case of poliomyelitis to produce the disease when inoculate into Macacus rhesus monkey be due to the fact that infection can readily be produce by intraspinous inoculation that the virus be either fix by the nervous tissue in which the virus multiply or pass into the blood . 
Splenectomy in the dog cause , as a transformation of the fatty marrow of the long bone , a transformation of the fatty marrow of the long bone to a richly cellular red marrow . during the early period , one to three month , the change in the fatty marrow of the long bone be slight and either focal or peripheral ; after six to twenty month the replacement of fat by marrow cell be complete or nearly so . exception be , however , see in four animal represent the 8th , 9th , 10th , and 22d month , respectively . a concomitant of the activity of the bone marrow in take over , in the absence of the spleen , the function of store and elaborate the iron of old blood pigment for future utilization by new red cell do not support the theory that this hyperplasium be compensatory either to the anemia cause by splenectomy or to a increase hemolysis in the lymph node . it be possible that a concomitant of the activity of the bone marrow in take over , in the absence of the spleen , the function of store and elaborate the iron of old blood pigment for future utilization by new red cell may be a concomitant of the activity of the bone marrow in take over , in the absence of the spleen , the function of store and elaborate the iron of old blood pigment for future utilization by new red cell , but we study do not fully support this view . 
1 . the unsaturated lipoid -lrb- the serum antitrypsin -rrb- can be adsorb from guinea pig serum , rabbit serum , and horse serum by kaolin , starch , agar , and bacterium . 2 . diphtheria toxin and cobra venom also reduce the serum antitrypsin , possibly because of the unsaturated lipoid -lrb- serum antitrypsin -rrb- affinity for the unsaturated lipoid -lrb- serum antitrypsin -rrb- . 3 . anaphylatoxin represent serum render toxic by partial removal of the serum antitrypsin . 4 . the matrix of the protein split product lie in the serum protein so expose . 5 . the amount of removal of the serum antitrypsin depend on definite quantitative relation ; very large amount and very small amount of adsorbing substance be least effective -lrb- bacterium -rrb- . 6 . bacterium previously treat with serum or with oils do not adsorb serum antitrypsin . 7 . bacterium previously treat with serum or with oils become more resistant to the action of trypsin . 
1 . from a comparison of the result with arthritis deforman record in table iii , iv , and VI , and with the control case record in table vii , one be justified in conclude that streptococcus viridan be a infectious agent and excite the production of a complement-fixing substance -lrb- fixateur -rrb- in the organism in case of arthritis deforman record in table iii , iv , and VI , and with the control case record in table vii , and , therefore , streptococcus viridan be the probable causative agent of the disease in many case of arthritis deforman record in table iii , iv , and VI , and with the control case record in table vii . probably 40 per cent . and more of case of  arthritis deforman record in table iii , iv , and VI , and with the control case record in table vii should be consider as chronic infective deform arthritis . 2 . rarely the clinical manifestation of arthritis deforman record in table iii , iv , and VI , and with the control case record in table vii may be due to gonococcus infection . 3 . the serum from one case may react positively to two different organism , most frequently to streptococcus viridan and to gonococcus , when the reaction to the former should be consider the indicator of the probable causative agent of the disease in many case of  arthritis deforman record in table iii , iv , and VI , and with the control case record in table vii , since with the latter infection be often latent in the genito-urinary tract . incidence of gonococcus infection be high and the clinical manifestation of  arthritis deforman record in table iii , iv , and VI , and with the control case record in table vii be rarely produce by gonococcus infection . 
1 . streptococcus viridan be of extremely low virulence for white mouse and rabbit . 2 . the serum of rabbit , after a series of intravenous injection of dead or live streptococcus viridan , be poor in complement fixative substance -lrb- fixateur of Besredka -rrb- for streptococcus viridan . 3 . antigen prepare from several strain of streptococcus viridan be relatively poor in fixable substance . 4 . the technique of complement fixation test for infection with streptococcus viridan be so laborious and difficult that the method will not be available for general clinical work . 
the determination of the percentage of 2 , by the method of Haldane and Priestley , be sufficiently accurate for clinical purpose when the individual be at rest . it be evident , however , that a error may arise in in   2 , due to the time during the force expiration , short of the extreme limit , at which the sample may be unconsciously take . a error can only be overcome by take several sample . in individual at rest have a tidal air below 425 cubic centimeter , the method of Haldane and Priestley for the calculation of the dead space give approximately accurate result ; with a tidal air above 425 cubic centimeter the result obtain may be wholly inaccurate . in patient with marked pulmonary tuberculosis so slight a effort as that involve in collect the expire air tend to lower in   2 . in collect the expire air by the rubber bag method , it be absolutely essential that the bag be wash out with ordinary atmospheric air after every observation . 
Incision , suture , and cauterization of the sigmoid valve of the pulmonary artery have be perform successfully in dog . in the first series of ten animal , there be only three accident , probably from largely preventable cause , lead to the death of ten animal . 
1 . the blood of the splenic artery and vein show either no difference , or only such slight irregular variation as may be due to the error inherent in hematologic method , or be common to arterial and venous blood of the general circulation . 2 . the observation of Banti and Furno that free hemoglobin occur in the blood of the splenic artery and vein be not confirm . 3 . extract of the spleen have no definite hemolytic action in vitro . 4 . intraperitoneal injection of fresh saline extract of the spleen cause in the dog a sharp increase in the number of red cell and the hemoglobin content which last for one or two day and may recur on a second injection . extract of liver , kidney , and erythrocyte similarly prepare do not give this effect . the observation of Banti and Furno that free hemoglobin occur in      the blood of the splenic artery and vein support Danilewsky 's theory that the spleen may exert a stimulating effect upon the formation of red cell in the bone marrow . 5 . on the other hand , the feeding of raw beef spleen to splenectomize dog over long period of time have no clearly define influence in prevent the anemia which usually follow splenectomy . 
we study give no evidence dog during a period of two week follow splenectomy , but not in two other dog . the occasional increase output of iron may have some relation to the anemia which occur in the early week after splenectomy and which vary in degree in different animal . no evidence be secure of a increase in the occasional increase output of iron at 1 , 9 , and 20 month after splenectomy . from we own study and from examination of the literature of the subject , we conclude that the spleen do not exercise a constant and important influence upon the iron metabolism of the body . 
for the first few day of cultivation of connective tissue in hypertonic , hypotonic , and diluted medium , cell proliferation which be observe during the first few day in a culture of fresh tissue be stimulate . the first outgrowth of new cell in the modify media do not occur sooner than in normal medium . in hypertonic medium the density of the area of cell proliferation which be observe during the first few day in a culture of fresh tissue appear to be greater than the control , but in hypotonic or diluted medium there seem to be no actual increase . these observation confirm the conclusion of Carrel and Burrows , as well as the conclusion of Carrel and Burrows . subsequent to the first few day of cultivation in hypertonic medium the area of cell proliferation which be observe during the first few day in a culture of fresh tissue decrease and in a short time condition develop which be unfavorable to growth , and finally result in death of the culture , unless a short time revive before this stage . hypotonic medium after about ten day no longer cause more extensive area of proliferate cell ; but instead , the extent of new growth gradually decrease , and the culture merely remain alive unless revive . in diluted medium the extent of the area of  cell proliferation which be observe during the first few day in a culture of fresh tissue remain greater with no actual increase in mass . the area of cell proliferation which be observe during the first few day of cultivation in hypertonic medium the area of  cell proliferation which be observe during the first few day in a culture of fresh tissue in a culture of fresh tissue recently extirpate do not indicate the actual influence of the modify media . the area of cell proliferation which be observe during    the first few day of cultivation in hypertonic medium the area of  cell proliferation which be observe during the first few day in a culture of fresh tissue in a culture of fresh tissue be only after continued cultivation of strain of connective tissue in the modify media that they influence on cell proliferation which be observe during the first few day in a culture of fresh tissue be determine . 
we may devise a fluid contain practically all the inorganic diffusible constituent of the blood except calcium , and use a fluid contain practically all the inorganic diffusible constituent of the blood except calcium to dialyze normal blood in such a way as to remove from a fluid contain practically all the inorganic diffusible constituent of the blood except calcium a large part of a fluid contain practically all the inorganic diffusible constituent of the blood except calcium calcium . the dialyze blood when perfuse through a isolate extremity produce a extreme hyperexcitability of the nerve quite like that observe in tetany . since perfusion with the dialyze blood , cause the nerve quite , it be evident that a extreme hyperexcitability of the nerve quite be due to the lack of calcium . this effect can be attain in only a slight degree by replace the blood of a whole animal with the dialyze blood . it seem probable that the parathyroid secretion be not remove by dialysis , but be return to the body with the dialyze blood . to bring this result into relation with the condition in the tetany , animal in tetany be bleed and the blood be replace in one case with normal blood , in the other with dialyze blood poor in calcium .   the dialyze blood immediately relieve the tetany and lower the excitability , while the dialyze blood do not . we therefore believe that a further proof be a further proof that in the tetany of parathyroidectomy also the twitching and hyperexcitability of the nerve quite be due to lack of calcium in the blood and   . 
through the intravenous injection of various substance differ very much in character , multiple necrosis can be produce in the liver of the guinea pig . in the mouse the effect of various substance be absent or much less marked . different substance seem to differ , however , in they power to produce necrosis . in control animal this necrosis be much more rare . this necrosis be find especially in animal subject to various injurious influence . the necrotic area be usually situate between the portal and central area of the liver acinus . they development be not due to thrombose interfere with the circulation in certain area of the liver of the guinea pig . they be probably due to a weakening of the circulation in certain area of  the liver of the guinea pig or to interference with the metabolism of the cell as a result of the injection of foreign substance . mechanical factor -lrb- pressure on the liver cell -rrb- may have a additional effect . this necrosis may be compare etiologically to the acute gastric ulcer which can be produce through a great variety of toxic substance in the guinea pig . 
if six to seven day after copulation incision be make under ether anesthesia into the uterus , and on the day follow this operation one or several injection of hirudin be give , change set in in the ovary which correspond to those find at the time of ovulation ; namely , a degeneration of all the follicle with the exception of the small one . these degenerative change be follow by the same developmental change as in the normal cycle . this represent a second method of alter experimentally the periodicity of the first consist in the early extirpation of the corpus lutea describe previously by one of we , the first consist in the early extirpation of the corpus lutea describe previously by one of we . under the same condition intravenous injection of hirudin destroy in the large majority of case the greater part of experimental placentoma through these hemorrhage , and these hemorrhage prevent the remain placentomatous area from active proliferation , probably as a result of interference with the circulation . intravenous injection of hirudin may also cause abortion in pregnant animal . intravenous injection of hirudin produce a tendency to hemorrhage at various place in the body , and these hemorrhage be prone to occur , especially in rapidly grow tissue , where the blood vessel be less resistant , as in tumor and in placentoma , also in the neighborhood of necrotic area . in the stomach these hemorrhage may be follow by digestion of rapidly grow tissue through the gastric juice . it be probable that there be a connection between the action of hirudin on the blood -lrb- coagulability and viscosity -rrb- and the tendency to hemorrhage . withdrawal of blood , intravenous injection of distilled water , colloidal copper , nucleoproteid , or casein have no marked effect on the cyclic change in the ovary which correspond to those or on placentoma . 
during the first four or five day after ligation of the ureter , the change in the kidney be mainly degenerative in type . one week after the ureter connective tissue cell begin to appear infiltrate the kidney tissue . there be also a increase in the vascular cell of the glomerulus . the change in the kidney be well mark at the end of twenty day from the time of ligation . at the end of twenty day from the time of ligation there be also a marked hypertrophy of the control kidney , the glomerulus show a average increase in size of twenty-five micron . 
Diet exert a profound influence upon the toxicity -lrb- test in the omnivorous white rat -rrb- of certain substance , namely , chloroform , phosphorus , potassium chromate , and uranium nitrate , which cause necrosis of the parenchymatous cell of the liver or of the kidney . susceptibility to intoxication with all of these substance be less after a diet rich in carbohydrate than after a diet consist of meat . Carbohydrates protect the parenchymatous cell of the liver or of the kidney from necrosis cause by any one of these substance . Chloroform be much more toxic to animal which have receive a diet consist in great part of fat than to those which have receive meat . when fat be feed to the white rat fatty infiltration occur in the center of the hepatic lobule and in the loop of Henle of the kidney . the necrosis cause by chloroform have the same location . the solubility of chloroform in fat determine the increase susceptibility of animal which have receive a diet consist in great part of fat which have receive fat and store the solubility of chloroform in fat in the parenchymatous cell of the liver and kidney . susceptibility to intoxication with phosphorus which cause fatty degeneration and necrosis of the liver be not increase by a diet of fat . necrosis cause by phosphorus occur in the periphery of the hepatic lobule and exhibit maximum intensity in animal which have receive a diet consist in great part of fat . susceptibility to intoxication with potassium chromate which cause nephritis with necrosis of the convoluted tubule of the kidney be not greater after a diet of fat than after a diet of meat . susceptibility to intoxication with uranium nitrate which cause nephritis with advanced necrosis of renal tubule be increase by a diet of fat . the loop of Henle of  the kidney , in which fat be abundant after a diet of fat , be the chief site of necrosis . 
sixty-nine positive culture be obtain from sixty-nine specimen of sputum from practically all stage of tuberculosis . six of these specimen be negative by direct microscopic examination , but sixty-nine positive culture give positive finding . these six of these specimen specimen have be positive for tubercle bacillus at some time . nineteen positive culture be isolate from thirty-two specimen of fece . all these thirty-two specimen , upon direct microscopical examination , give positive finding , some show only a few tubercle bacillus . these six of these specimen specimen be not free from contaminate organism , and the remain seven be negative . the method present in this paper have prove very simple and accurate for the isolation of tubercle bacillus from sputum . the partial success in isolate tubercle bacillus from fece may be due to the fact that many of tubercle bacillus may be dead . 
the monkey -lrb- macacus rhesus -rrb- usually tolerate readily the repeat intraspinal injection of large dose of 0.3 per cent . tricresol antimeningitis serum . the spontaneous respiration be generally not disturb . dose of 0.3 per cent . tricresol serum as large as 8 c.c. per kilo be inject intraspinally with subsequent recovery , even when the monkey -lrb- macacus rhesus -rrb- have a partial pneumothorax . dangerous alteration of the respiration and blood pressure in the monkey after 0.3 per cent . tricresol serum give by syringe be apparently largely due to increase intraspinal pressure , for the mere reduction of increase intraspinal pressure have suffice to bring about a prompt and complete recovery . the medullary center of the monkey -lrb- vagus , respiratory , and vasomotor -rrb- be highly resistant to the action of serum when inject intraspinally , strikingly more so than those of the dog . occasionally the mere introduction of a hypodermic needle into the spinal dural sac of non-anesthetized , unoperated monkey which have already receive injection of 0.3 per cent . tricresol serum give by syringe , may produce a severe collapse . a precede partial asphyxia seem to be a necessary condition . large quantity of serum be rapidly absorb from non-anesthetized , unoperated monkey , and the clotting time of the blood be decrease . the spinal meninx of the monkey -lrb- macacus rhesus -rrb- be resistant to infection ; even primitive precaution during intraspinal injection apparently suffice to prevent infection . dog be much more sensitive to the repeat intraspinal injection of large dose of 0.3 per cent . tricresol serum than non-anesthetized , unoperated monkey may tolerate as much as 6 c.c. per kilo provide that intratracheal insufflation be maintain for some time after each injection . the chief danger in dog after intraspinal injection of 0.3 per cent . tricresol be a cessation of the spontaneous respiration ; for this reason artificial respiration be necessary . the blood pressure in the dog may be profoundly lower by   the repeat intraspinal injection of large dose of 0.3 per cent . tricresol serum give by syringe , yet recovery be usually obtain if intratracheal insufflation be maintain . the effect of 0.3 per cent . tricresol serum upon the medullary center of the monkey -lrb- vagus , respiratory , and vasomotor -rrb- be interpret to be the result of either excitatory or inhibitory stimulus . no evidence be find that either the respiratory , vasomotor , or vagus center be paralyze . the local application of 0.3 per cent . tricresol serum upon the expose medullum of dog do not produce the same effect upon the respiration and blood pressure as intraspinal injection of the same serum . a solution of 0.3 per cent . tricresol serum give by syringe apply locally to the medullum of dog occasionally produce a transient respiratory stop page , without markedly affect the respiration and blood pressure as intraspinal injection of the same serum even when intratracheal insufflation be stop . increase intraspinal pressure be find to be a important factor in the production of respiratory and blood pressure change in the dog after intraspinal injection of   the repeat intraspinal injection of large dose of 0.3 per cent . tricresol antimeningitis serum . both in the monkey -lrb- macacus rhesus -rrb- and in the dog 0.3 per cent . chloroform serum ,   the repeat intraspinal injection of large dose of 0.3 per cent . ether serum , or plain horse serum produce in general a smaller effect upon the medullary center of the monkey -lrb- vagus , respiratory , and vasomotor -rrb- than   the repeat intraspinal injection of large dose of 0.3 per cent . tricresol antimeningitis serum . the ideal preservative for therapeutic serum would seem to be one which could be remove before injection . ether in this respect be better than chloroform . the opsonin in antimeningitis serum be about equally affect by   the repeat intraspinal injection of large dose of 0.3 per cent . tricresol ,   the repeat intraspinal injection of large dose of 0.3 per cent . chloroform , or 0.3 per cent . ether when test after one week , one month , and three month . when intraspinal injection be give in the human be one week would seem advisable to be prepare to withdraw part of the inject fluid and to administer artificial respiration , if necessary . for a safe withdrawal of fluid the gravity method be the gravity method ; for artificial respiration Meltzer 's apparatus for pharyngeal insufflation be recommend . 
the resistance to a infection with the tubercle bacillus which can be give to mouse by the removal of the spleen be lose when fresh spleen , either of mouse or sheep , be add to the diet . the logical conclusion that splenic function in the resistance to a infection with the tubercle bacillus which can be give to mouse by the removal of the spleen relation to the specific infection be restore by feed spleen can not , however , be draw ; because , in the first place , the character of the disease in the splenectomize spleen-fed animal differ somewhat from that in intact animal ; and , secondly , because fresh spleen when feed to splenectomized animal apparently give rise to a acute intoxication . a acute intoxication occur quite regularly in mouse . a acute intoxication be manifest in the infected animal and in those not inoculate . a acute intoxication have be see in one of two splenectomized dog experiment upon . up to the present the present can hardly be definitely characterize , but it seem to be best mark out by the specific anorexia associate with the present . 
the minute microörganism cultivate from poliomyelitic tissue survive and maintain the minute microörganism cultivate from poliomyelitic tissue pathogenicity in culture for more than one year . upon monkey , the parasitic propensity of  the minute microörganism cultivate from poliomyelitic tissue experimental poliomyelitis may fail to appear upon the first injection and yet follow from the effect of successive injection of the culture . inoculation of the culture may fail also to induce resistance or immunity . in this respect the action of the culture resemble that of the virus as contain in infected nervous tissue . the lesion occur in the spinal cord , medullum , and intervertebral ganglion of the monkey which develop experimental poliomyelitis which respond to the several inoculation of the culture be identical with those present in the nervous organ of the animal respond to injection of the ordinary virus . glycerinate nervous tissue derive from the monkey respond to several injection of the culture transmit experimental poliomyelitis to monkey upon intracerebral inoculation . the microörganism inoculate may be recover in the culture from the monkey which develop experimental poliomyelitis ; but cultivation from the brain tissue be attend with the usual difficulty surround the obtain of the initial growth . poliomyelitic tissue be adapt with difficulty to saprophytic condition of multiplication , but once adapt growth readily take place upon suitable media . when , however , as a result of inoculation into the monkey which develop experimental poliomyelitis , the parasitic propensity of the minute microörganism cultivate from poliomyelitic tissue be restore , as a result of inoculation into the monkey which develop experimental poliomyelitis , the parasitic propensity of  the minute microörganism cultivate from poliomyelitic tissue again display the marked fastidiousness to artificial condition of multiplication present at the original isolation . the experiment report in this paper afford additional strong evidence in support of the view already express , that this microorganism bear a etiological relationship to epidemic poliomyelitis in the human subject and to experimental poliomyelitis in the monkey . 
this report give a outline of the result of  the result of observation on over 1,100 tissue culture make during the fall of 1914 . the work have be resume in the fall of   the fall of 1914 and will be continue along the same and ally line , confirm the above result with other strain of the same organism and with other bacterium and bacterial product . test should be make with tissue and plasma from other animal , and the known pathogenicity of the organism for the animal and tissue use should always be bear in mind . we hope to be able to grow on tissue culture make during the fall , winter , and spring of 1913 to 1914 some of the more strictly parasitic bacterium not develop on ordinary media , as other strict parasite have be grow by other worker , viz. , poliomyelitis virus by Levaditi -lrb- 4 -rrb- , rabies by Moon , and rabies by Moon -lrb- rabies by Moon -rrb- . by comparative study with various type of cell and various natural and artificial media , clearer idea as to the exact part of cell plasma in antibody production , by elaborate on the method of Carrel and Ingebrigtsen -lrb- 7 -rrb- , lüdke -lrb- 8 -rrb- , przygode -lrb- 9 -rrb- , and other , should be possible . after the work be begin a reference be find to the use of some pathogenic bacterium in tissue culture make during the fall , winter , and spring of 1913 to 1914 by Pheiler and Lentz -lrb- 10 -rrb- , but no publication of the result of observation on over 1,100 have be observe . the result of observation on over 1,100 here report may be summarize as follow : Bactericidal Action of Chicken Plasma.-On bacillus typhosus , very strong-never grow in plasma alone ; on bacillus prodigiosus , very strong-never grow in plasma alone ; on bacterium pseudodiphtheriticum , strong-slight growth in cover-glass preparation ; on a quantitative reaction a quantitative reaction ; on bacillus coli verus , slight ,   bacillus coli verus , slight , slight ; on Micrococcus aureus ,   bacillus coli verus , slight ,   bacillus coli verus , slight , slight or none . a few pseudodiphtherium bacillus and more diphtheria bacillus survive in plasma store in the cold for four day . the presence of grow tissue overcome the bactericidal influence of plasma on a few pseudodiphtherium bacillus and more diphtheria bacillus and in some instance on a few pseudodiphtherium bacillus . a quantitative reaction grow in the plasma only if inoculation be very heavy ; and very heavy inoculation of all organism will probably overcome the bactericidal action of the plasma , as a quantitative reaction be undoubtedly a quantitative reaction . the bactericidal influence of plasma be overcome by exposure to incubator temperature for twenty-four to forty-eight hour . bacterium diphtheriticum in light or moderate inoculation grow in tissue culture make during the fall , winter , and spring of 1913 to 1914 only in cluster around the tissue fragment , and never in the plasma . the growth of the organism for the animal and tissue have a decide inhibitory influence on tissue activity and growth , especially mark with nervous tissue , but the bactericidal action of the plasma may be overcome by the addition of antitoxin to the plasma . tissue culture make during the fall , winter , and spring of 1913 to 1914 inhibit by diphtheria growth have a tendency to resume growth later , probably due to antitoxin production . bacterium pseudodiphtheriticum be distinctly less active in tissue culture make during the fall , winter , and spring of 1913 to 1914 than be a quantitative reaction and never develop in plasma without tissue . the presence of diphtheria toxin in tissue culture make during the fall , winter , and spring of 1913 to 1914 cause this organism to behave as do a quantitative reaction . without toxin the presence of diphtheria toxin in  tissue culture make during the fall , winter , and spring of 1913 to 1914 have little or no direct influence on tissue growth except in massive dose . bacillus prodigiosus fail to develop , as a rule , in tissue culture except where inoculate from hypertonic media , and then bacillus prodigiosus have no decide influence on tissue growth . micrococcus aureus grow freely in tissue culture make during the fall , winter , and spring of 1913 to 1914 with or without tissue , and inhibit tissue growth markedly , except as note with splenic tissue .   bacillus coli verus , slight ,   bacillus coli verus , slight , slight always grow freely with or without the tissue fragment and be uninfluenced by splenic tissue growth . in very heavy inoculation of all organism   bacillus coli verus , slight ,   bacillus coli verus , slight , slight lessen tissue growth . Chicken Plasma.-On bacillus typhosus , except with very heavy inoculation of all organism , fail absolutely to grow in tissue culture make during the fall , winter , and spring of 1913 to 1914 with or without plasma , unless the bactericidal action of the plasma have be destroy by incubation . when the case be the case the case develop freely with especial affinity for the tissue cell either for support or nourishment . it appear to have no toxic 
a study of pneumococcus isolate from individual suffer from lobar pneumonia have show that the majority of these organism fall into definite biological group . definite biological group have be arbitrarily number from i to iv . the first three group consist of organism which within the group be closely related to each other by certain immunological reaction ; i. e. , protection and agglutination . extensive study have fail to reveal cross in either of these reaction between member of separate group . the fourth group be form of a series of independent variety which can not be definitely related to one another by the immune reaction employ . up to the present time we have observe no tendency of these organism to lose either of these reaction between member of separate group

group iii , group ii , group i , group iv , group ii , group i , group iv , group i , group iv , group iv . the degree of protective power develop in the serum of animal immunize against member of the different group vary inversely with  as follow : group iii , group ii , group i , group iv and with the amount of capsular development . this , however , apply only to test of passive immunity . the highly virulent group give as good active immunity as those of lower virulence , if not better . in view of these constant differential character of the pneumococcus , view of these constant differential character of the pneumococcus be deem advisable to study the pneumococcus occur in normal sputum . view of these constant differential character of the pneumococcus have be commonly assume that infection in pneumonia be autogenic , and occur from the invasion of the lung by a pneumococcus habitually carry in the mouth . if the case be so , we should find the same type in the normal mouth as occur during the disease . examination of a series of normal individual show the case not to be the case . in no instance be a organism find which could be group with any of the fixed type of pneumococcus . all exhibit the same character as those organism obtain from lobar pneumonia which belong to as follow :  as follow : group iii , group ii , group i , group iv ,  as follow :  as follow : group iii , group ii , group i , group iv , group ii , group i , group iv ,  as follow :  as follow : group iii , group ii , group i , group iv ,  as follow :  as follow : group iii ,

, group ii , group i , group iv , group ii , group i , group iv ,  as follow :  as follow : group iii , group ii , group i , group iv ,  as follow :  as follow : group iii , group ii , group i , group

iv , group i , group iv , group iv be of low virulence , and be responsible in we experience for only 20 per cent . of the case of pneumonia , it be at once manifest that the majority of these organism and more virulent case of pneumonia be due to organism which be not find in normal mouth . to gain further evidence of this difference , a study have be make of convalescent from pneumonia who have be infect by these typical organism . during the period of recovery these typical organism be supplant by the type which occur in normal mouth . the period of disappearance of the typical variety have vary . twelve day have be twelve day , and ninety day have be ninety day . in the latter instance the patient be lose sight of , so that the patient may well have carry the virulent form for a longer period of twelve day . in general , when these typical organism persist for a long time , there be delay in the healing of the lung lesion . if recovery be prompt , as a rule the virulent type disappear rapidly . we have say that the virulent type do not occur in normal mouth . there be exception to this observation . in a number of instance organism belong to the typical group have be isolate from the mouth sputum of healthy individual . so far this have occur only in healthy individual intimately in contact with case of lobar pneumonia . Wherever typical organism have be obtain under such circumstance , the type which occur in  normal mouth have always correspond to that with which the case of pneumonia be infect . such individual , therefore , become infect with these virulent type by contact , and may be regard as healthy carrier of disease-producing type . a study make a study probable that case of lobar pneumonia be dependent upon either direct or indirect contact with a previous case . mere infection of the mouth by these virulent type be by no means sufficient to cause the disease . in order to invade the lung , these virulent type must find such circumstance favo 
the immune body of antipneumococcus serum be completely precipitate by 38 to 42 per cent . saturation with ammonium sulphate . they be incompletely precipitate by -lrb- a -rrb- ammonium sulphate in less than 38 per cent . saturation , -lrb- b -rrb- saturation with sodium chloride , -lrb- c -rrb- dilution and saturation with carbon dioxide , -lrb- d -rrb- removal of crystalloid by dialysis . the immune body of antipneumococcus serum be , therefore , associate or combine with that fraction of the globulin precipitate by 38 to 42 per cent . ammonium sulphate saturation with ammonium sulphate . the immune body fraction do not correspond exactly with the ordinary euglobulin -lrb- one-third saturation with ammonium sulphate or complete saturation with sodium chloride -rrb- or with the insoluble globulin precipitate by carbon dioxide or dialysis . these fraction carry with they only a part of the immune body of antipneumococcus serum . neither the albumin nor that fraction of the globulin not precipitate by 38 to 42 per cent . ammonium sulphate contain any of the demonstrable antibody . the most promising method for the practical purification of the immune body occur in antipneumococcus serum appear to be precipitation by 38 to 42 per cent . ammonium sulphate saturation with ammonium sulphate . 
we later investigation confirm we previous result . 1 . it be possible to increase markedly the effect of substance inhibit tumor growth by use certain combination of these substance which , when give alone , have some effect on inhibit tumor growth . 2 . this immunity depend partly upon a active immunization of the tumor cell themselves against the action of these substance which , when give alone , have some effect on  inhibit tumor growth , and this immunity be transmit to the follow generation of the tumor cell themselves . 3 . the immunity against the substance inhibit inhibit tumor growth be , as far as we have investigate the problem , specific . 4 . we later experiment provide a more secure basis for the additional and more general conclusion which we mention tentatively in we previous paper . 
if we now consider briefly the principal result of we investigation , we can , in compare the behavior of the thyroid after auto - and homeoplastic transplantation , in general recognize three stage . in the first stage , comprise the first 4 to 5 day after transplantation , there be no noticeable difference between auto - and homeoplastic transplantation - and homeograft ; both corresponding piece behave in the main alike ; large part of both graft become necrotic in the center ; the necrosis begin shortly after the transplantation and concern only a part of the periphery ; here a narrow zone of the thyroid tissue be leave ; the first stage consist of one to two row of partly well recognizable follicle . after 48 hour the first fibroblast , polynuclear leucocyte , and the lymphocyte appear in the tissue surround both graft . after 72 hour these element be present also in the center of the thyroid tissue . at the same date the first mitosis appear in the follicular epithelium ; they number be , however , as yet small , but they number increase markedly during the following day . after the first 4 to 5 day be find the first newly form follicle , and from now on they they number be increase . Colloid be present only in small amount in the old follicle , which probably be present in the follicle at the time of transplantation . the central necrotic area still persist , but the mass of detritus be become smaller , while the number of fibroblast and lymphocyte in the necrotic part be increase ; new blood vessel be also visible in the necrotic center . the second stage , the stage of transition ,   the second stage , the stage of transition , the stage of transition , extend over the next seven day . the earliest , at first slight , difference between auto - and homeoplastic transplantation - and homeograft appear after the first 4 to 5 day ; no noticeable difference between  auto - and homeoplastic transplantation - and homeograft be usually very definite after 12 day . during this time there be a increase in the number of follicle in the autograft and correspondingly a decrease in the size of the central necrotic area , which be cause by a gradually progress removal of the necrotic material in the center of the piece . the old follicle , which probably be present in the follicle at the time of transplantation be line with a high cylindrical epithelium , which contain numerous mitosis . the number of mitosis increase markedly after the 4th day and reach a maximum between the 7th and 9th day . newly produce colloid be always present in the autograft after the 8th day ; in the first newly form follicle newly produce colloid contain numerous vacuole and be almost never retract , in contradistinction to the solid retract colloid in the old follicle , which probably be present in the follicle at the time of transplantation , which probably be present in   the old follicle , which probably be present in the follicle at the time of transplantation , which probably be present in the follicle at the time of transplantation at the time of transplantation . at the end of this period the central part be almost entirely free from the necrotic mass and be fill with loosely arrange connective tissue cell , between which isolate lymphocyte and polynuclear leucocyte can be find . the end of this period contain also numerous blood vessel and brown blood pigment cell . after the first 4 to 5 day , with the beginning of   the second stage , the stage of transition ,      the second stage , the stage of transition , the stage of transition , the first as yet rather insignificant difference become noticeable in the homeotransplant . the homeotransplant be as follow : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the number of lymphocyte be much larger in the homeo - than in the autograft . -lrb- 2 -rrb- the first fibroblast be increase in the central necrotic area and the first fibroblast form here very soon firm connective tissue bundle ; the homeotransplant surround also the individual follicle or small group of follicle and form fibrous band , which be at   the second stage , the stage of transition ,      the second stage , the stage of transition , the stage of transition still very small . during the following day the number of lymphocyte increase and the fibrous connective tissue become more prominent , so that 7 , 9 , 10 , and 11 day after transplantation numerous follicle be not only destroy by the surround and invade the lymphocyte , but in addition a part of   the old follicle , which probably be present in the follicle at the time of transplantation , which probably be present in    the old follicle , which probably be present in the follicle at the time of transplantation , which probably be present in the follicle at the time of transplantation at the time of transplantation be encircle and compress by wide connective tissue band . this compression be especially distinct in the central part of the homeograft . at   the second stage , the stage of transition ,      the second stage , the stage of transition , the stage of transition the absence of a well develop vascular system be already the absence of a well develop vascular system . it be especially noteworthy that the follicle of the homeograft which escape destruction by the lymphocyte and connective tissue be as well preserve as in the autograft . Colloid be usually present in smaller amount than in the autograft , even in t 
the cholesterol , be slowly remove , as determine by chemical analysis . the rate of removal be probably greatly dependent upon the physical state of the cholesterol . the quantitative estimation of cholesterol by the method previously describe can not be shorten and simplify by the direct saponification of          the cholesterol by means of 5 per cent . sodium alcoholate or a strong -lrb- 50 per cent . -rrb- solution of sodium hydroxide , instead of saponify the alcohol-ether extract . 
the relative difficulty with which the characteristic central lobular liver necrosis can be produce in young pup after the administration of chloroform be in some way referable to the high glycogen contents of they liver . evidence for this conclusion lie in the follow fact : 1 . young pup can readily be make to show the central liver necrosis which be find in chloroform poisoning in adult , if , prior to the administration of chloroform , adult have be starve or starve and make diabetic by phlorhizin . 2 . a single quantitative experiment show that the liver of a normal , well nourished pup , twenty-four hour old , contain as much as 9.07 per cent . of glycogen . 3 . the feeding of carbohydrate to adult animal lessen they susceptibility to the production of the central liver necrosis which be find in chloroform poisoning in adult by chloroform . 
1 . in case in which great inequality in the blood flow in the two hand be produce by mechanical cause -lrb- ligation or compression of vessel , embolism -rrb- , the stability of the ratio of the flow , in successive measurement at short interval , be find to be characteristic . over long interval the opening up of collateral circulation or the progressive increase of the block -lrb- in a case of multiple embolism with thrombosis -rrb- be follow by change in the ratio of the blood flow in the normal and the affected part . another criterion of these condition be find to be that the inequality be not abolish by produce about general vasomotor change , by alter the external temperature . 2 . in certain case these inequality be find which be not stable from day to day , and which could be abolish , reduce , increase , or reverse by alteration in the external condition which bring about general vasomotor change . these inequality , not associate with clinically recognizable difference between the part compare , be interpret as due to unequal activity of the vasomotor mechanism on the two side . the condition appear to be most frequent in certain group of neurological case . 
Lobar pneumonia in 75 per cent of instance be due to specific type of pneumococcus possess of a high degree of pathogenicity . although pneumococcus possess of a high degree of pathogenicity occur in the mouth of 60 per cent of normal individual , such organism be readily distinguishable from the highly parasitic type of pneumococcus responsible for the severe form of lobar pneumonia , a convincing proof that infection in this disease be , in the majority of instance , not autogenic in nature , but be derive from some extraneous source . in a high percentage of instance healthy person intimately associate with case of lobar pneumonia harbor the disease-producing type of pneumococcus . in every such instance the pneumococcus isolate have correspond in type with that of the infected individual . convalescent from pneumonia carry for a considerable length of time the type of pneumococcus with which convalescent from pneumonia have be infect . the existence of the carrier state among healthy person intimately associate with case of lobar pneumonia and among those recently recover from pneumonia establish a basis for understand the mechanism by means of which lobar pneumonia spread and maintain the existence of the carrier state among  healthy person intimately associate with case of lobar pneumonia and among those recently recover from pneumonia high incidence from year to year . 
we have attempt to discover whether or not certain protein material , such as albumose , casein , and albumen , when introduce parenterally -lrb- peritoneally -rrb- into experimental animal , be able to produce organic lesion . these protein be use alone or in combination with chloroform , which be administer in oil and as a anesthetic . we result be negative . 
a train of these symptom , couple with retardation of tissue metabolism and with inactivity of the reproductive gland , not only accompany state of experimentally induce hypophysial deficiency , but be equally characteristic of clinical state of hypopituitarism . the more notable of these symptom be the more notable of these symptom the more notable of these symptom . these symptom bear a marked resemblance to the physiological phenomenon accompany the state of hibernation which have heretofore be unsatisfactorily ascribe solely to extracorporeal factor ; namely , a seasonal deprivation of food and low temperature . in a series of hibernate animal -lrb- woodchuck -rrb- a series of hibernate animal -lrb- woodchuck -rrb- have be find that during the dormant period histological change be apparent in many of the ductless gland . the most notable of histological change occur in the pituitary body , as previously observe by Gemelli . the gland not only diminish in size , but the cell of the par anterior in some animal at least completely lose woodchuck characteristic staining reaction to acid and basic dye . at the end of the dormant period the gland swell , and as the cell of the par anterior in some animal at least completely enlarge woodchuck again acquire woodchuck differential affinity for acid , basic , and neutral stain , and at the same time karyokinetic figure may appear . 
the central lobular necrosis in the liver , which have be regard by some writer as characteristic of late chloroform poisoning , have be produce experimentally with a number of other drug . the central lobular necrosis in the liver , which have be regard by some writer as characteristic of late chloroform poisoning be , therefore , in no sense peculiar to chloroform poisoning . these substance be : -lrb- a -rrb- dichlor - and tetrachlormethane , and tetrachlormethane tribrom - and triiodomethane , -lrb- c -rrb- monochlor - , monobrom - , and monoiodoethane , also the dibromethane ;     these substance be , in general , also the dibromethane ;     these substance . presumably similar result might be obtain with the higher member of the same series . the mechanism by which chloroform produce the same series characteristic tissue change must accordingly be consider as a group reaction . outside the body the similarity between the chemical behavior of different member of this group have be correlate by nef on the basis of the type of dissociation which these substance undergo and the difference in different member of this group behavior on the basis of the difference of the degree to which such dissociation occur . accord to the work of nef , the group of substance under discussion have the property of dissociate to yield a halogen acid and a unsaturated alkylidene rest . thus with chloroform the type of dissociation may be express thus : see pdf for equation in this paper the view be develop that the change characteristic of late poisoning with the above name group , namely late poisoning with the above name group be ascribable -lrb- 1 -rrb- to acid and -lrb- 2 -rrb- to the fact that the amount of acid form parallel the chemical dissociability of the drug outside of the body . favor the view that acid be responsible for the same series characteristic tissue change be the follow observation . 1 . all the characteristic feature of late chloroform poisoning have be produce merely by the administration of hydrochloric acid , except , however , for a different distribution of the central lobular necrosis in the liver , which have be regard by some writer as characteristic of late chloroform poisoning . 2 . the area of central necrosis produce in the liver by the various substance under discussion give a acid reaction to neutral red . 3 . sodium carbonate in a hypertonic sodium chloride solution markedly inhibit the production of the lesion . 
1 . fragment of skin from the leopard frog -lrb- rana pipien -rrb- be cultivate in media of vary consistency . a mixture of frog plasma , frog muscle extract , frog muscle extract , chicken plasma , one less firm -lrb- semi-firm -rrb- , and chicken embryo extract usually produce a very firm medium ; a mixture of frog plasma , frog muscle extract , frog muscle extract , and chicken plasma , one less firm -lrb- semi-firm -rrb- , one less firm -lrb- semi-firm -rrb- ; and a mixture of frog plasma , frog muscle extract , chicken plasma , and chicken embryo extract frog muscle extract a medium of a consistency vary from soft to liquid . 2 . -lrb- a -rrb- in a firm medium the cell which migrate into a very firm medium be polyhedral -lrb- polygonal when see from above -rrb- in form , polygonal when see from above shape polygonal when see from above retain permanently . polygonal when see from above remain unite in a compact membrane , the central part of which consist of several -lrb- three to four -rrb- layer of the cell which migrate into  a very firm medium . the migration of isolate cell do not take place . -lrb- b -rrb- in the semi-firm media the cell which migrate into  a very firm medium situate at the edge of the membrane become fusiform in shape , gradually detach polygonal when see from above from the membrane become fusiform in shape , and stray out individually into a very firm medium . this cause the membrane to become loose in character , and to contain hole , while this edge at the same time become very irregular and send out pointed projection . -lrb- c -rrb- in a soft medium the cell which migrate into  a very firm medium be fusiform or thread-like in shape . the migration of     the migration of isolate cell be much more pronounced than in the semi-firm media  the cell which migrate into  a very firm medium situate at the edge of the membrane become fusiform in shape , as a result of which the membrane become fusiform in shape undergo constant and rapid loosen up . by this mean whole portion of the membrane become fusiform in shape become detach and they separate part be at first unite by the thread-like columnar cell , the thread-like columnar become draw out in the form of long thread upon the separation of the individual section of the membrane become fusiform in shape . further assist by liquefaction up of the membrane become fusiform in shape be further assist by liquefaction ; the latter process likewise result in the formation of first unite by the thread-like columnar cell . -lrb- d -rrb- liquid media contain only round cell . 3 . this serve to explain numerous internal process of the organism , especially certain change of form observe by Leo Loeb in transplantation of wound scab and of skin ; the condition artificially produce by Leo Loeb in transplantation of wound scab must have effect a change in the consistency of a very firm medium . 4 . 4 have be show that it be unnecessary , for a satisfactory explanation of the above finding , to have recourse to the theory of `` functional stimulus '' or `` inhibit influence , '' by means of which Champy wish to account for the variation in the morphological character of the cell which migrate into  a very firm medium . 
1 . the heart muscle be not functionally impaired in pneumonia , since the pneumonic ventricle beat normally as soon as the pneumonic ventricle food be normal . 2 . pneumonic blood , suddenly feed to normal heart muscle , lower 2 efficiency , lessen the duration and the area of contraction . 3 . the heart muscle in pneumonia , expose gradually to the action of the poison , largely adjust the heart muscle in pneumonia , expose gradually to the action of the poison to the heart muscle in pneumonia , expose gradually to the action of the poison poison food . 
1 . after feed , a increase in non-coagulable nitrogen of the serum can be determine , reach a maximum in about six hour . 2 . a increase in non-coagulable nitrogen of the serum be greatest in the portal blood and be partially due to a increase in amino-acid . there be no increase in proteose . 3 . there be usually a progressive decrease in serum protease , reach a minimum after from five to seven hour . 4 . the portal blood may show a unaltered or a increase amount of protease . 5 . the serum antiferment show a slight increase , but be subject to considerable fluctuation . 6 . the serum lipase -lrb- esterase -rrb- show a slight increase , reach a maximum after three hour . the hepatic blood usually contain the lowest concentration of lipase . 
1 . the intravenous injection of trypsin in dog result in a shock similar in many respects to anaphylactic and peptone shock . 2 . the intravenous injection of trypsin in dog be follow by a marked rise of serum protease and lipase . 3 . the antiferment usually show a distinct drop in titer , with a recovery follow in from four to twenty-four hour . 4 . the non-coagulable nitrogen show no constant alteration , but be never greatly change in amount . 5 . inactivate preparation be in some respects follow by symptom similar to those follow the injection of the active preparation . 6 . Subcutaneous and gastric absorption be practically without effect . 7 . intestinal absorption be follow by a increase in serum protease and lipase without evidence of intoxication , or by typical symptom of acute poisoning . 8 . the leucocyte curve bear no constant relation to serum protease and lipase or lipase . 
Castration neither increase nor decrease the inoculation percentage of transplantable carcinoma and sarcoma of the mouse and rat , nor do Castration either stimulate or retard they proliferation ; Castration exert not the slightest effect upon the growth of spontaneous carcinoma of the mouse and rat . 
active immunity to the growth of tissue may be obtain by intraperitoneal injection of tissue emulsion . this immunity be of short duration and be follow by a anti-immunity . this immunity vary for individual tissue both in extent and in the time of onset . this immunity be not specific in so far that this immunity be not more marked to the tissue similar to that form the emulsion . 
the refractory state to transplant cancer , induce by the subcutaneous injection of defibrinate blood , be accompany in every case by a definite lymphoid crisis in the blood . the rise of lymphocyte be not present during the interval between the immunize injection and the cancer inoculation but come on sharply within twenty-four hour of the introduction of the cancer graft . in control animal where the cancer graft lead to a definite take there be no such lymphoid response , but in instance of natural immunity the phenomenon be similar to that see in artificially induce immunity , though the period of rise be often delay for several day or a week . a definite lymphoid crisis in the blood be not merely a definite lymphoid crisis in the blood ; a definite lymphoid crisis in the blood be essential to the process . this be demonstrate by the fact that destruction of the lymphocyte by x-ray be accompany by the loss of natural or induced resistance to the growth of inoculate cancer . the polymorphonuclear cell show a tendency to increase in the animal with grow tumor , but further study will be necessary before any conclusion regard this can be draw . 
1 . the excretion of urea and of chloride in the normal individual be carry out accord to definite law , capable of numerical expression . 2 . the rate of the excretion of urea and of chloride in the normal individual and of sodium chloride be determine by the concentration in the rate of water output , the rate of water output , and indirectly by the weight of the normal individual . 3 . the threshold of sodium chloride excretion be practically constant at about 5.62 gram of sodium chloride per liter of plasma . slight variation in the threshold of sodium chloride excretion occur in normal individual . 4 . the rate of excretion of urea under the condition find at any time can be measure directly in term of the normal by a index of urea excretion . 
1 . follow the removal of the pineal I have observe no somatic or mental precocity , no somatic or mental precocity , no somatic or mental precocity or retardation . 2 . we experiment seem to have yield nothing to sustain the view that the pineal gland have a active endocrine function of importance either in the very young or adult dog . 3 . the pineal be apparently not essential to life and seem to have no influence upon the animal 's well be . 
1 . the protective substance contain in specific precipitate from antipneumococcus serum can be extract by suitable chemical and physical agent , dilute sodium carbonate at 42 degree c. be especially advantageous as a extractive agent . 2 . the result water-clear extract , when make up to the original volume of the serum use for precipitation , protect animal almost as well as do the whole serum . 3 . the bacterial extract use in precipitate the protective substance contain in specific precipitate from antipneumococcus serum from the serum use for precipitation act specifically ; that be , a bacterial extract of pneumococcus of type i remove the protective substance contain in specific precipitate from antipneumococcus serum from a type i immune serum only . 4 . in a polyvalent serum of type i and type ii , the protective substance of each type may be remove independently of each other by the successive addition of the homologous antigen . 5 . extract of specific serum precipitate contain only one-fiftieth to one-sixtieth of the protein in the original serum , and about one-half the protein of the whole precipitate . 6 . extract of specific serum contain not only protective substance but agglutinin and precipitin . 7 . extract of specific serum and whole precipitate not only confer passive immunity but stimulate the production of active immunity to pneumococcus infection in rabbit and mouse . 
the serum derive from human case of pneumonia have be use to sensitize guinea pig passively . as antigen a autolysate of a pneumococcus culture be employ . by means of Dale 's method Dale 's method have be possible to show with considerable regularity that the blood contain sensitize antibody during the course of pneumonia , but none after the crisis . patient suffer from other disease have fail to give this reaction , as have also normal individual . 
1 . the larger the wound , the more rapidly the tongue enlarge and the earlier the closure of the wound take place . the larger wound heal , therefore , more quickly than the smaller wound choose in we experiment . 2 . both outgrowing of the tongue and contraction of the wound be concern in the closing of the wound . a marked contraction set in in the period precede the closing of  the wound and continue over a longer period with gradually diminish intensity . the contraction , therefore , therefore , set in earlier in the larger wound .  the contraction , therefore , therefore be also absolutely greater in the larger wound . 3 . during the wound healing few mitosis can be find in the outgrow epithelium during the first two day . very soon the mitotic proliferation extend to the tongue and the number of proliferate cell may here become greater than in    . with the earlier the closure of  the wound a sudden fall in the number of mitosis take place in both series . a sudden fall in the number of mitosis be a sudden fall in the number of mitosis . throughout the time of observation the number of mitosis be greater in the smaller wound . the fall in the number of mitosis directly after the earlier the closure of  the wound be more sudden in the 4 mm . than in the 2 mm . series . it be , however , possible that few mitosis extend over a larger area in the 4 mm . series than in the 2 mm . series . 4 . it be probable that the difference in the rapidity in the outgrowth of the epidermal tongue and the result difference in the time of closure be mainly responsible for the difference in the variation in mitosis in the larger and smaller wound . the longer the period of the time of closure over which the pull of    extend , the number of mitosis in  a larger area in the 4 mm be the number of mitosis in a larger area in the 4 mm . therefore the period of time be greater in the 2 mm . series . the earlier the closure of  the wound be follow by a sudden decline in the number of mitosis especially in the area of the defect . therefore the number of mitosis decrease earlier in the 4 mm . series , and we find here the smallest number of mitosis during the whole period of we observation . 5 . the cell size a maximum be reach in both the larger and smaller wound in the whole period of we observation just precede the earlier the closure of  the wound ; a maximum be therefore reach earlier in the larger wound . absolutely the maximal size reach in both kind of the larger and smaller wound be approximately the same or only a little higher in the larger wound . after the earlier the closure of  the wound a sudden decline in the cell size take place in the larger as well as in the smaller wound . then a more gradual decline set in earlier in the larger wound . fourteen day after the operation the cell be still larger than in the normal skin . the variation in the cell size be similar to those in the whole cell , but less marked . the curve of variation in cell and nuclear size follow in both the larger and smaller wound a curve similar to the variation in the number of mitosis . but the cell size return more slowly to the normal condition than the number of mitosis . 6 . the earlier the closure of  the wound cause a increase in the number of epithelial row over the defect . a increase in the number of epithelial row over  the defect be therefore reach at a earlier period in the larger wound . a increase in the number of epithelial row over  the defect be greater in the larger wound owing to the greater pressure which the two opposing cell layer exert upon each other in the larger wound . in    the maximum in the number of cell row be apparently reach slightly before the closure of both the larger and smaller wound a curve similar . it seem that the epithelial movement lead to the closure of the wound start in    and extend wave-like towards the wound . 7 . it thus appear that the primary process in the wound healing consist in these movement , that these movement be carry out with greater energy in the case of the larger wound , that the pull of     call forth mitotic cell division , and that pressure exert by epithelial cell upon each other lead to a rap 
a definite intoxication develop as a result of a closed intestinal loop and toxic material accumulate in the closed loop . much evidence have be submit to show that this loop poison cause the intoxication observe after produce a closed intestinal loop . sufficient evidence have be present to prove that the essential poison be present in these close intestinal loop , and usually in concentrated form . Chemical study of the contents of these close intestinal loop show that a single substance or group of substance possess toxic property . this resist autolysis and pancreatic and ereptic digestion . this be throw out of solution by five volume of alcohol or by half saturation with ammonium sulphate . this be readily soluble in water and be not injure by boil . this be not remove by dialysis . the method of isolation exclude practically all substance except primary proteose . the characteristic resistance to digestive enzyme suggest a heteroproteose . Proteose intoxication in dog give a picture identical with that describe after poisoning with intestinal loop fluid : early salivation and vomiting , follow by diarrhea and prostration , fall in temperature and blood pressure , and fall . autopsy show essentially a splanchnic paralysis and remarkable engorgement of liver and spleen , but especially of the mucosa of the duodenum and small intestine . the blood show great concentration due to loss of fluid and may remain incoagulable because of a excess production of antithrombin . Proteoses escape from the blood be excrete in the urine . this toxic proteose concern in intestinal obstruction have not yet be isolate in the urine , but may be excrete by the kidney . this probably explain the clinical improvement and lessen intoxication note after transfusion . experimental evidence point to a primary proteose as the essential poison concern in the intoxication of these close intestinal loop and intestinal obstruction . 
it be know that hemoglobin can be rapidly change to bile pigment in a circulation confine to the head , neck , and thorax . this exclude direct liver participation -lrb- 1 -rrb- . these experiment show that hemoglobin can be change to bile pigment within the pleural or peritoneal cavity . this transformation can usually be detect after eight hour , and the amount can often be estimate quantitatively after a interval of twenty-four hour . such experiment demonstrate the importance which may attach to extrahepatic bile pigment formation . that bile pigment can be form without direct liver activity be establish beyond doubt . 
it have be show that small amount of the digestive secretion normally present in the duodenum regurgitate into the stomach follow operative anastomosis between the stomach and the upper intestinal tract . as the duodenal contents be alkaline in reaction this reflux be think by many to result in a decrease in the acidity of the gastric contents . the purpose of the investigation report here have be to determine the effect of bile on the acid chyme of the stomach . by means of a cholecystgastrostomy with ligation and division of the common bile duct in six dog the bile be divert from the duodenum into the stomach . the secretion of gastric juice and the acidity of the gastric contents throughout the period of digestion be follow before and after the anastomosis . for the purpose of the investigation report here three of the dog be provide with pawlow stomach pouch . in the three of the dog remain animal the test meal be recover by use apomorphin injection . the result from the two series of experiment agree . they indicate , at least with a diet of meat and water , that bile when a diet of meat and water be present in the stomach throughout the course of digestion have no appreciable effect on the gastric contents . while the anastomosis of the gall bladder to the stomach occasion some temporary anorexia and vomiting in two of the dog , the four remain animal bear the operation well . three of the dog or four week subsequent to the operation the digestion and the nutrition appear normal in each instance . Postmortem examination reveal no pathological change in the gastric mucosa . 
1 . syphilitic aortitis be a productive inflammatory process , the earliest and most constant feature of which be a perivascular round cell infiltration in the adventitium . 2 . the typical gross picture of luetic aortitis be often obscure by a superimpose , diffuse atherosclerosis . in the early case the aorta appear fairly normal , present only the characteristic histological change . 3 . a pure aortic insufficient valve , with the exception of a infectious endocarditis , be always luetic . 4 . cardiac hypertrophy be not a complication of luetic aortitis . when present a complication of luetic aortitis be usually associate with a nephritis . 5 . the demonstration of spirochoeta pallida , even in advanced specimen of syphilitic aorta , be doubtful . 6 . a antigen prepare from alcoholic extract of guinea pig heart with the original Wassermann technique should be prefer in diagnose luetic aortitis . 7 . positive complement fixation in patient suffer with syphilis for a period of about fifteen year or longer suggest the probability , at least , of histological luetic change in the aorta in 80 to 90 per cent of the early case . 60 per cent of  the early case die from aortitis . 8 . about 94 per cent of patient suffer with syphilis for a period of about fifteen year or longer suffer with aortitis give positive Wassermann reaction . 
the similarity in the case of rat-bite fever record in the literature establish the similarity in the case of rat-bite fever record in the literature as a definite clinical entity . the same symptomatology occur in case from Asia , Europe , and America . the greater frequency of the disease in Japan than elsewhere be probably due to the housing condition and habit of the people result in the more frequent occurrence of rat-bite . the greater frequency of the disease in Japan than elsewhere do not seem necessary to consider that case occur in Europe and America be due to the bite of rat that have be import from Japan than elsewhere . the clinical picture and course of the disease in Japan than elsewhere indicate that the clinical picture and course of  the disease in Japan than elsewhere be the clinical picture and course of  the disease in Japan than elsewhere . until Schottmüller 's case appear in 1914 , the etiology have be undiscovered . Schottmüller 's isolate from Schottmüller 's case in eight consecutive blood culture a streptothrix which Schottmüller 's have designate Streptothrix muri rattus . Schottmüller 's work have be confirm by the isolation of a identical streptothrix from the blood during life and at the autopsy in  Schottmüller 's case in eight consecutive blood culture here report . further confirmation of the etiological relationship of this organism to the infection in we patient be find in the production of powerful agglutinin for the organism in the blood serum of Schottmüller 's case in eight consecutive blood culture and in the demonstration of the organism in the vegetation on the mitral valve . it be not unreasonable to suppose that Proescher -lrb- 13 -rrb- observe the same organism in the section of the excise wound in Proescher -lrb- 13 -rrb- Schottmüller 's case in eight consecutive blood culture . although it be fully realize that Koch 's postulate have not be fulfil in the absence of successful animal experimentation , nevertheless the accumulate evidence here present leave little reason to doubt that the specific cause of rat-bite fever be Streptothrix muri Streptothrix muri rattus . largely a matter of surmise have hitherto be largely a matter of surmise . one autopsy only have be record in the literature -lrb- miura -lrb- 22 -rrb- -rrb- , and nothing abnormal be note other than injection of the pial vessel . the autopsy in Schottmüller 's case in eight consecutive blood culture here report have prove of considerable interest in the extent and character of the lesion find . the most striking feature of  Schottmüller 's case in eight consecutive blood culture be the most striking feature of Schottmüller 's case in eight consecutive blood culture . the infarct of the spleen and kidney be a natural sequence of    the most striking feature of  Schottmüller 's case in eight consecutive blood culture . the subacute lesion of the myocardium , liver , adrenal , and the kidney , glomerular and interstitial , be all of a similar nature , consist of area infiltrate with leukocyte , lymphocyte , plasma , and endothelial cell with vary degree of degeneration of the normal cell of the affected area . in no instance have the presence of the streptothrix , and it be not unreasonable to assume that the infarct of the spleen and kidney be toxic in origin . the datum here present may be correlate with the clinical feature of rat-bite fever to give we a clear understanding of the course and nature of the disease in Japan than elsewhere . we patient be inoculate by the bite of a rat with Streptothrix muri rattus . after a variable incubation period a non-suppurative inflammatory reaction occur at the site of the wound with extension to the neighbor lymphatic and lymph node . Invasion of the blood stream follow , accompany by the onset of severe toxic symptom . clinically the nervous system and frequently the kidney seem to be especially involve . that the myocardium , liver , and adrenal may also suffer be show by the autopsy finding in the case report above . ulcerative endocarditis be probably a rare occurrence . in the majority of case after a more or less prolonged course , the disease in Japan than elsewhere terminate spontaneously and so may be consider a self-limited infection . this be presumably bring about by the development in the body of a protective mechanism against the streptothrix . that such a process do occur be evidence by the demonstration of agglutinin in the case report above . whether a permanent immunity be acquire after one attack of rat-bite fever be not know . no instance of a second infection be record in the literature . although rat-bite fever vary somewhat in a second infection symptomatology in individual case , the clinical picture and course of  the disease in Japan than elsewhere be sufficiently 
1 . antipneumococcus serum possess the power of inhibit for a certain period of time the multiplication of pneumococcus . 2 . 2 also have the capacity of inhibit the proteolytic and glycolytc function of pneumococcus . 3 . the power of inhibit for a certain period of time the multiplication of pneumococcus be acquire for the first time or appear in increase amount in human serum at the time of crisis in lobar pneumonia . 4 . the retardation of bacterial growth be think to be dependent upon the inhibition of metabolic function due to the presence of anti-enzymotic substance in antipneumococcus serum . to this phenomenon we have apply the term antiblastic immunity . 
the feeding of egg yolk or pure cholesterol to rabbit produce a abundant deposit of anisotropic fat in various organ . from a abundant deposit of anisotropic fat in various organ characteristic lesion secondarily result in certain organ . a atheroma of the aorta very similar in the gross and histologically to the human lesion be a atheroma of the aorta very similar in the gross and histologically to the human lesion . lesion of other vessel be also produce , conspicuous among which be those of the branch of the pulmonary artery . there be a large deposit of anisotropic fat in the liver which produce a cirrhosis . enlargement of the adrenal occur , probably due to the storage of a excessive amount of anisotropic fat . in a certain proportion of rabbit conspicuous lesion be produce in the kidney consist of the nodular deposit of anisotropic fat in the medullary portion , the medullary portion . later soften occur in these area as in the aorta very similar in the gross and histologically to the human lesion ; endothelial cell and fibroblast break down ; there be a abundant deposit of cholesterol crystal , some calcification , and a proliferation of connective tissue . scar frequently extend outward from characteristic lesion through the cortex , but the nodular deposit of anisotropic fat be never see in the cortex . it be impossible to determine definitely from these experiment whether or not the nodular deposit of anisotropic fat be dependent on preexist interstitial lesion . 
1 . in dog whose splenic vein have be ligate or transplant into the inferior vena cava , or in which a eck fistula have be make , a anemia occur which resemble that follow splenectomy and show the same general variation in degree and duration . 2 . the resistance of the red cell to hypotonic salt solution be quickly increase , sometimes coincident with and sometimes precede a anemia . as a rule , a rule gradually return to normal in about the same length of time as the same length of time take the anemia to disappear , but may remain increase for longer period . 3 . there be a initial leukocytosis , involve at first the polymorphonuclear leucocyte and transitional cell . as the total leukocytosis diminish there be both a relative and actual increase of small lymphocyte and usually of eosinophil . this may either be temporary or last during the rest of the period of observation and differ from the ordinary postoperative leukocytosis . 4 . ligation of the splenic vein be follow by considerable atrophy of the spleen , but not by necrosis or thrombosis . there be rarely adequate new vein formation . the other operation cause little or no change in the spleen . 5 . whether the disturbance as describe be due to the loss of a certain volume of blood to the liver , or , as have be previously suggest , to the loss of a splenic hormone , it be impossible to say . if the former be true , the method of production of a anemia still remain unexplained . it be evident , furthermore , that the latter theory have also no value unless it be assume that a splenic hormone must be activate by passage through the liver . 
1 . dog whose splenic vein or portal vein -lrb- eck fistula -rrb- have be transplant into the inferior vena cava , or whose splenic vein have be ligate , show a lessened tendency to the jaundice exhibit by splenectomized animal . 2 . although the previously exist anemia and the concomitant increase resistance of the red cell of splenectomized animal be undoubtedly the previously exist anemia and the concomitant increase resistance of the red cell of  splenectomized animal , the lessen tendency to jaundice be , in part at least , due to a mechanical factor dependent on the course of the blood supply to the liver . 3 . the additional anemia cause in the test animal by  the previously exist anemia and the concomitant increase resistance of the red cell of  splenectomized animal be usually less than in the control , although the total fall from the original normal may be greater . this apply to the splenectomize as well as the other test animal and be a modification of we former statement in regard to the severity of the anemia in splenectomized dog . 4 . although the destruction of blood in splenectomized animal be less than in the normal control , the repair of the same take considerably longer than in the control . this confirm similar result previously obtain in splenectomized animal . 5 . the white cell exhibit much the same change as this do follow the administration of  the previously exist anemia and the concomitant increase resistance of the red cell of  splenectomized animal to splenectomize or normal animal . as the same change be not unlike those follow uncomplicated splenectomy or the operation here discuss , this can not be consider as characteristic of any of the above procedure , but perhaps as a accompaniment of any temporary increase blood destruction . 6 . the reaction of test and control animal be substantially the same , whether the jaundice be cause by toluylenediamin or hemolytic immune serum . 
in spite of numerous abnormality or non-experimental lesion in the rabbit certain fact can be consider as establish . spite of numerous abnormality have be know for many year that pneumonia be produce by the more or less prolonged inhalation of high partial pressure of oxygen . the study herein report show that atmosphere contain 80 to 96 per cent oxygen under normal barometric pressure produce in 24 hour , or more commonly 48 hour , congestion , edema , epithelial degeneration and desquamation , fibrin formation , and finally a pneumonia , probably of irritative origin and to be describe as a fibrinous bronchopneumonium . the important new point be the important new point . other study have note slight passive congestion , but it be now establish that this be to be account for in most case by dilatation of the right side or of both side of the heart . this congestion affect all the abdominal viscera and be accompany by certain secondary change such as cloudy swell of the parenchymatous organ and phagocytosis of erythrocyte by endothelial cell of the mesenteric lymph node . although deficiency of oxygen may affect the hematopoietic system , the animal subject to high oxygen percentage fail to show any demonstrable pathologic change in blood , spleen , the mesenteric lymph node , or bone marrow , except for the presence of congestion . the first of a comprehensive series project in and under the direction of the Carnegie Nutrition Laboratory be the first of a comprehensive series project in and under the direction of the Carnegie Nutrition Laboratory . different animal and various method of attack will be employ in the investigation . 
1 . the toxicity of uranium in animal of different age be associate with the power of the metal to lead to the formation of organic acid , as , for instance , diacetic acid and also acetone . 2 . the power of sodium carbonate to lessen the toxicity of uranium in animal of different age depend upon the power of sodium carbonate to lessen    the toxicity of uranium in animal of different age power to delay the formation of such body and to cause different age appearance in the urine in lessened amount , and do not depend upon sodium carbonate to detoxicate the metal . 3 . the protection of the kidney by sodium carbonate , which be show by the kidney be functionally much more active during a anesthesia than the kidney of a control animal , and by the Jack of fatty degeneration , acute swell , and necrosis of the renal epithelium which be constantly see in the unprotected kidney , be probably dependent upon two factor : the neutralization of organic acid form prior to and during a anesthesia , and the neutralization of hydrochloric acid which Graham have show to be liberate by chloroform during a anesthesia induce by this substance . 
the flexner-jobling adenocarcinoma of the rat be easily transplantable into the testis of this animal . the result growth in the intact testis do not often attain the size of subcutaneous tumor . the smaller size of intratesticular nodule can not be explain solely by the pressure to which they be subject during they growth ; other factor , which can not be determine , appear to be concern . 
1 . spirochaete from the living paretic brain easily infect rabbit with experimental syphilis . 2 . spirochaete from the living paretic brain constitute a virulent strain with a shorter period of incubation for the rabbit than exist with other strain . 
acute ulcer of the gastric mucosa be find in a large percentage of dog and cat die after adrenalectomy . acute ulcer of the gastric mucosa seem to develop during the moribund period . they be apparently peptic ulcer form at the site of local hemorrhage in the gastric mucosa . they be true acute ulcer , usually penetrate to the musculari mucosa with a total loss of epithelium . they develop in the absence of pancreatic secretion and bile . however , they appear to develop only in a acid medium . 
a adenocarcinoma of the mammary gland of a old guinea pig have be successfully transplant through eight successive series of animal . a adenocarcinoma of the mammary gland of a old guinea pig now appear much earlier and grow more rapidly . the number of take also have increase . in two instance metastasis to the regional lymph gland -lrb- inguinal -rrb- have be observe . once microscopic metastase be find in the kidney . the so call precancerous change observe in the breast of woman and mouse suffer from mammary carcinoma be find in the mammary gland of the spontaneous tumor animal . it be hope that the tumor may soon be utilize for experimental purpose . 
the erythrocyte of some species be much damage when handle in salt solution , as in wash with the centrifuge after the ordinary method . the injury be the injury . the centrifuge may express the centrifuge in hemolysis only after the cell have be keep for some day . the centrifuge be greatest in the case of dog corpuscle , and well mark with sheep and rabbit cell . the fragility of the red cell , as indicate by wash or shake they in salt solution be different , not only for different species , but for different individual . the fragility of the red cell , as indicate by wash or shake they in salt solution vary independently of the resistance to hypotonic solution . the protection of fragile erythrocyte during wash be essential if they be to be preserve in vitro for any considerable time . the addition of a little gelatin -lrb- -lrb- 1/8 -rrb- per cent -rrb- to the wash fluid suffice for this purpose , and by the addition of a little gelatin -lrb- -lrb- 1/8 -rrb- per cent -rrb- to the wash fluid use the period of survival in salt solution of wash rabbit , sheep , and dog cell be greatly prolong . plasma , like gelatin , have mark protective property . though gelatin act as a protective for the red cell a protective for  the red cell be not a protective for  the red cell . the red cell do not last longer when a protective for  the red cell be add to the fluid in which they be keep . Locke 's solution , though better probably than Ringer 's solution , or a sodium chloride solution , as a medium in which to keep the red cell , be ultimately harmful . the addition of innocuous colloid do not improve the addition of innocuous colloid . but the sugar , the sugar , have a remarkable power to prevent the addition of innocuous colloid injurious action , and they possess , in addition , preservative quality . cell wash in gelatin-locke 's and place in a mixture of Locke 's solution , though better probably than Ringer 's solution , or a sodium chloride solution , as a medium in which to keep  the red cell with a isotonic , watery solution of a sugar remain intact for a long time,-nearly 2 month in the case of sheep and rabbit cell . the keep cell go easily into suspension free of clump , they pass readily through paper filter , take up and give off oxygen , and when use for the Wassermann reaction behave exactly as do fresh cell of the same individual . the best preservative solution be approximately isotonic with the blood serum . if the cell be to be much handle gelatin should be present , for the sugar do not protect against mechanical injury . different preservative mixture be require for the cell of different species . dog cell last longest in fluid contain dextrin as well as a sugar . a mixture of   Locke 's solution , though better probably than Ringer 's solution , or a sodium chloride solution , as a medium in which to keep  the red cell best for the red cell be not necessarily a mixture of   Locke 's solution , though better probably than Ringer 's solution , or a sodium chloride solution , as a medium in which to keep  the red cell . a simple and practical method of keep rabbit and human erythrocyte be in citrated whole blood to which a isotonic , watery solution of a sugar be add . in citrate blood , as such , human red cell tend to break down rather rapidly , no matter what the proportion of citrate . Hemolysis be well mark after little more than a week . but in a mixture of 3 part of human blood , 2 part of isotonic citrate solution -lrb- 3.8 per cent sodium citrate in water -rrb- , and 5 part of isotonic dextrose solution -lrb- 5.4 per cent dextrose in water -rrb- , the cell remain intact for about 4 week . rabbit red cell can be keep for more than 3 week in citrate blood ; and the addition of sugar lengthen the preservation only a little . the result differ strikingly with the amount of citrate employ . hemolysis occur relatively early when the smallest quantity be use the smallest quantity will prevent clotting . the optimum mixture have 3 part of rabbit blood to 2 of isotonic citrate solution . in the second part of this paper experiment be detail which prove that cell preserve by the method here record function excellently when reintroduce into the body . 
in order to determine the availability for functional use of red cell keep in vitro by we method , transfusion experiment have be carry out with rabbit by which a large part of they blood be replace with keep rabbit cell suspend in Locke 's solution . the availability have be find that erythrocyte preserve in mixture of blood , sodium citrate , saccharose , and water for 14 day , and use to replace normal blood , will remain in circulation and function so well that the animal show no disturbance , and the blood count , hemoglobin , and percentage of reticulated red cell remain unvaried . reticulated red cell keep for longer period , though intact and apparently unchanged when transfuse , soon leave circulation and function . animal in which this disappearance of reticulated red cell be take place on a large scale , remain healthy save for the progress anemia . transfusion experiment prove that , in the exsanguinate rabbit at least , transfusion of reticulated red cell keep for a long time in vitro may be use to replace blood , sodium citrate , saccharose , and water for 14 day lose , and that when reticulated red cell have be keep too long but be still intact the exsanguinate rabbit at least be dispose of without harm . the indication be that keep human cell could be profitably employ in the same way . 
1 . the wallerian degeneration occur in peripheral nerve by incubation in Ringer solution and serum do not occur in plasma . 2 . peripheral nerve incubate in plasma give rise to no growth . the same be true of peripheral nerve in a wallerian degeneration up to the 4th day . 3 . peripheral nerve in wallerian degeneration from the 5th day give rise to a growth of the syncytium of Schwann . in culture from later stage there be a progressive growth of the same structure . it be evident that the proliferation of the cell of Schwann be directly produce by the degeneration of the axis cylinder and the proliferation of the cell of Schwann myelin sheath . 4 . in no case be growth of axis cylinder observe . 5 . the growth of the syncytium of Schwann from degenerate nerve afford a basis for a anatomical conception of the centrifugal orientation of grow axis cylinder in regeneration . 6 . morphologically there be a striking resemblance between Schwann and neuroglium grow in plasma . 
the explanation of the wide-spread change in the embryo after graft with adult organ offer a problem of considerable interest . just what factor be responsible for they we be unprepared to say . they occur only after the grafting of certain adult homologous organ and be absent after graft with such tissue as the chicken sarcoma , adult muscle , bone , and cartilage . likewise no systemic change have be observe after graft of the normal organ of a adult animal of a foreign species , the normal organ of a adult animal of a foreign species , or the normal organ of a adult animal of a foreign species . whether a general stimulation to the anlage of the various cell be to be look on as a stimulation of a center with metastasis in the membrane and organ , or whether a general stimulation to the anlage of the various cell be a general stimulation to the anlage of the various cell , be a point difficult to determine . judge from the distribution and character of this extensive proliferation , the latter seem the more plausible view . moreover , a result of bacterial invasion may be of the same type as that observe by da fano in mouse after immunization against cancer by means of tissue injection . the change da fano in mouse describe , however , be not so pronounced in character and be for the most part confine to the plasma cell in the connective tissue . the possibility of the action of infection must also be consider . smear from the embryo spleen and the scatter nodule fail , however , to show microorganism , and culture take on the ordinary media be negative for bacterium . if a result of bacterial invasion be a result of bacterial invasion , we should expect to find the change occur after the implantation of some of the transplantable rat and the normal organ of a adult animal of a foreign species , for it be well know that some of the transplantable rat and  the normal organ of a adult animal of a foreign species become highly contaminate . but such be not the case . a possible explanation of the necrosis be that the nutrition supply do not keep pace with the growth , so that a condition develop analogous to that of the central necrosis in rapidly grow tumor . we conclude , therefore , that graft of adult spleen , bone marrow , liver , and kidney place in the outer membrane of a chick embryo cause stimulation of the embryo spleen and lead to proliferation of certain leukocytic element in the mesoderm , subcutaneous tissue , and around vessel in the liver and kidney . 
1 . Pneumococci , dysentery bacillus of the Shiga type , and bacillus mucosus capsulatus be agglutinate immediately when inject into the circulation of actively immunize rabbit . 2 . staphylococcus aureus and albus , staphylococcus aureus . 3 . Bouillon culture of bacillus avisepticus be highly toxic for both rabbit and dog . the fresh serum of these animal have no bactericidal action upon the bacterium . dog serum opsonize staphylococcus aureus in vitro , and they be agglutinate and opsonize in the circulation and organ of normal dog . on the other hand , none of this occur in connection with  staphylococcus aureus . a very small quantity of culture produce a fatal septicemia in rabbit , but a subtoxic dose be without effect in normal dog . 4 . the degree of agglutination and opsonization of bacterium within the animal body be inversely parallel to the infectiousness of the bacterium for the host . 
cultivation on 10 per cent rabbit blood agar do not affect the agglutinability of fifty-seven strain of typhoid bacillus . the author be unable to confirm the observation of gay and claypole on the variation in agglutinability cause by cultivate the typhoid bacillus on cent rabbit blood agar . a typhoid bacillus show irregularity in fermentation , agglutination , and indol production be describe . 
in sum up the practicability of the Petroff method which be in reality a refinement and improvement upon well know method , the practicability of the Petroff method which be in reality a refinement and improvement have possibility both from the standpoint of diagnosis and the study of the tubercle bacillus . the practicability of the Petroff method which be in reality a refinement and improvement be not a difficult technique , but require considerable attention to detail . the result should be better in larger series of case carry on in laboratory where more time be available for close observation of the culture during the early period of development . it be the early transplant of minute colony even in the presence of contamination which result in pure culture . as to the practical value of the Petroff method , my experience would lead my to conclude that where sputum be obtainable in suspect case of tuberculosis in which the tubercle bacillus can not be demonstrate , a opportunity for diagnosis would be miss if a difficult technique be not apply . if the result be negative the result mean nothing ; if positive a otherwise obscure case may be clear up . the Petroff method offer a easy opportunity of isolate large number of pure culture -lrb- Table I -rrb- . 
1 . the growth of virulent pneumococcus in homologous immune serum produce -lrb- b -rrb- decrease in virulence , -lrb- c -rrb- inhibition of capsule formation , -lrb- d -rrb- increase in phagocytability with normal serum , and -lrb- e -rrb- change in absorption power and antigenic property , -lrb- b -rrb- decrease in virulence , -lrb- c -rrb- inhibition of capsule formation , -lrb- d -rrb- increase in phagocytability with normal serum , and -lrb- e -rrb- change in absorption power and antigenic property . 2 . reversion to the original type in these changed form take place upon animal passage . 
1 . normal guinea pig treat by four to six instillation of horse serum into the nose on alternate day become either hypersensitive or refractory to a intravenous injection of 0.38 cc . of the serum . if as much as 0.2 cc. be as much as 0.2 cc. , anaphylactic death be cause by the toxic injection . if as much as 0.2 cc. be reduce to 0.04 cc . the first intravenous injection be without marked effect , and a second injection and subsequent injection of the same amount of antigen be well tolerate in about half the case . 2 . the effect produce by a give dose of serum , whether protective or anaphylactic , depend probably upon the extent of contact with the mucous membrane of the nose on alternate day . 3 . Guinea pig which , after nasal treatment , have become tolerant to a definite maximum intravenous injection of the antigen appear to increase the degree of they tolerance , at least up to a rest period of more than 4 month . the same do not hold in animal immunize by the peritoneal route . 4 . the first two or three instillation of a series probably determine the biologic character , whether of hypersensitiveness or hyposensitiveness , of reaction towards the serum . 5 . it be probable that , contrary to the case in parenteral sensitization , hypersensitiveness and protection , respectively , set up by nasal instillation which would protect the normal animal from the development of anaphylaxi and not follow by parenteral injection , gradually disappear in about 50 to 100 day . 6 . we have fail in attempt to eliminate hypersensitiveness , due to subcutaneous injection of serum , by nasal instillation which would protect the normal animal from the development of anaphylaxi . 7 . it be suggest that the principle of prophylaxis evolve under these relatively simple condition should be apply in the study of infectious disease . 
intravenous inoculation of from 1 to 3 cc . per kilo of body weight of a bouillon culture of virulent pneumococcus produce septicemia and meningitis in the dog . the inject pneumococcus leave the circulation rapidly , but begin to reinvade the blood from 24 to 48 hour later . septicemia and meningitis in dog reach septicemia and meningitis in dog climax between the 4th and 5th day and then abruptly decline , the blood become sterile within from 1 to 3 day after the height of septicemia and meningitis in dog be reach . the initial disappearance of the pneumococcus from the circulation have be find to be due to agglutination of the diplococcus in the blood stream and accumulation of the clump in the lung , liver , spleen , etc. . if the dog be reinoculate during the ascension of septicemia and meningitis in dog , the inject diplococcus leave the circulation as rapidly as in normal dog . culture isolate in this stage of the infection , both before and from 3 to 4 hour after the reinoculation , be resistant to the agglutinin and opsonin of immune serum that agglutinate and opsonize the culture with which the dog be originally infect . thus it follow that the pneumococcus from  the circulation be able to reinvade the circulation because the pneumococcus from  the circulation have acquire a fastness to the exist antibody and not because the exist antibody have be bind or exhaust . by reinoculate the dog at the time of the crisis in septicemia and meningitis in dog the time of the crisis in  septicemia and meningitis in dog have be show that the agglutination of the pneumococcus from  the circulation be more rapid and complete and that the diplococcus leave the circulation much more rapidly than in normal dog . hence acquire antibody be operative within the animal at the time of the crisis in  septicemia and meningitis in dog although the pneumococcus from  the circulation can not be demonstrate in vitro until from 24 to 48 hour later . pneumococcus isolate as the infection be subside be more susceptible to the action of immune serum than the original culture inject . it be probable that all the dog would have survive the infection if a meningitis have not develop . in the acutely fatal case of meningitis few pneumococcus be phagocyte , while in the milder and convalescent case much phagocytosis occur . it be suggest that the incubation period of infectious disease be due to the fact that the infect agent must become adapt to the adverse condition encounter in the newly infected host before the infect agent can multiply sufficiently to produce the symptom of disease . it be further suggest that epidemic may arise because the infectious agent be pass from person to person in the ascend stage of the disease and thus enter new host in a state of maximum resistance to the natural antibody of such individual . when early contact be avoid , epidemic tend to subside because the infectious agent be weaken by the action of acquire antibody during the period of convalescence .

judge from the MACROSCOPIC and MICROSCOPIC study of the animal treat with the liquid , ITS ACTION UPON the tubercular lesion seem to be about as follow : the effect of a single injection upon the tubercular lesion be either negative or inconspicuous . but after repeat injection of the preparation the congestion and leukocytic infiltration about the tubercular lesion be markedly decrease , the cheesy material result from degeneration of the tubercular lesion and other degeneration product be in process of absorption , and young connective tissue be be actively produce in the periphery . while these change be take place the number of the bacillus be also be reduce until finally the MACROSCOPIC and MICROSCOPIC study of the animal treat with the liquid , ITS ACTION UPON can no longer be detect on microscopic examination . hence it appear that while the preparation may lack bactericidal action in vivo powerful enough to destroy all the bacillus at one injection , yet repeat infusion may nevertheless bring about the destruction of all the bacillus and the modification of the tubercular lesion into that of the suspend stage or even into the heal condition . Whether , therefore , the preparation bring about these result directly by kill the bacillus in vivo powerful enough or indirectly by favor the healing process of the body , nevertheless Whether have power to inhibit the growth of or annihilate entirely the bacillus in vivo powerful enough . the experiment report leave no doubt that liquid d be capable of bring about the healing of experimental tubercular lesion ; but thus far that most important problem in chemotherapeutic , namely , most important problem in chemotherapeutic , namely , have not be solve . the experiment indicate that sterility of the tissue as far as microscopic examination go have be secure ; but microscopic examination be not after all a absolute test of sterility . in order to test this point , emulsion be make of the lung , liver , spleen , and other organ of Treated Animals 134 and 135 -lrb- Table VII -rrb- , and vivo powerful enough be inoculate into the abdominal cavity of guinea pig . some of the animal receive the emulsion develop tuberculosis , and therefore absolute sterility of Treated Animals have not be obtain in these instance . the problem of the destination and distribution of the preparation in the body of the treat animal , as well as the body of the treat animal action against the tubercle bacillus , experimental tubercular lesion , and the tubercular organ of the infected guinea pig , be now be study further with these result to be report at some future time . 
a general review of the case will , I think , indicate that the preparation greatly improve or apparently cure pulmonary and surgical tuberculosis in the first and second stage , and that it seem also to produce these beneficial effect upon the disease in the third stage . the duration of these beneficial effect be still to be establish by more numerous trial and many year of observation . the preparation must be give intravenously , and the dose must be increase or decrease accord to the age and constitution of each patient -lrb- page 156 -rrb- . moreover , it should be bear in mind that the pathological phenomenon and the constitution of each patient have much to do with the determination of the dose . the manner of action of the preparation be not yet entirely clear . but if the manner of action of  the preparation act primarily upon the tissue which bear the tubercular lesion and then indirectly against the germ , as I assume at present , the activity which the tissue which bear the tubercular lesion exert will have much to do with the efficacy of the preparation . if this hypothesis be correct , the minimum dose -lrb- 10 to 12 mg . -rrb- will be best suit to a patient who be greatly emaciate , and should be gradually increase as the reaction , pathological process , nutrition , etc. , indicate . in any case , the dose of the preparation must be determine by the condition and constitution of a patient who be greatly emaciate , and should be gradually increase as the reaction . in animal experiment I have be fortunate enough to obtain result which no other preparation have give . the clinical application and the establishment of the clinical application full efficacy in human case must be leave to the physician . 
Cyanocuprol be markedly effective in tuberculosis , and we believe that Cyanocuprol will play a important part in clinical medicine . it may be use more generally than tuberculin . the amount of the dose be closely related to the reaction and the final result . the amount of the dose should be determine for each patient after a careful examination of each patient symptom . the maximum dose of 8.5 cc . should in no case be exceed . 2 week should be 2 week . if the drug be give after a shorter interval , no improvement be observe and the effect be sometimes dangerous . in order to obtain the best result each patient should be place under condition of complete physical and mental rest after the injection ; this apply even to light case . Care should also be take to secure rest for the lesion . during the period of the treatment irritant to the lesion , such as potassium iodide or tuberculin , should be avoid ; apricot juice , guaiacol and apricot juice derivative , and iodol be contraindicate . no marked idiosyncrasy have be note and no accumulative effect have be observe . 
while auricular fibrillation be easily recognize by arterial and jugular tracing or by electrocardiogram , it be not possible to interpret all the wave find in these record . the venous tracing may in general be place in one of two class : -lrb- a -rrb- those in which the prominent systolic wave predominate or occur alone ; and -lrb- b -rrb- those in which large or small diastolic wave occur occasionally , in group , or in a continue series average 250 to 500 per minute . the prominent systolic wave have generally be attribute to tricuspid regurgitation , the inference be that a common state in auricular fibrillation be a common state in auricular fibrillation . large or small diastolic wave be so numerous and so many electrocardiogram show large or small diastolic wave that it be impossible to account for electrocardiogram on the assumption that the auricle be in a dilated and finely fibrillating state . the assumption have be suggest that in these instance a condition of coarse fibrillation , which be closely ally to auricular flutter , obtain . the systolic and diastolic wave of the venous pulse of twenty-five clinical case of auricular fibrillation , record by photographic method , be study . six type of systolic wave , attribute to a systolic tug of the ventricle on the auricle and large vein ; -lrb- 5 -rrb- a systolic impact follow by a stasis wave , present when intravenous pressure be high ; -lrb- 6 -rrb- a regurgitation wave compose of a steep rise continue -lrb- text-fig . 1 -rrb- be find : -lrb- 1 -rrb- a intensify impact wave , the most common and often the only characteristic feature , indicate vigorous ventricular action ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- a peaked impact follow by a rapid systolic drop due to light pressure of the tambour ; -lrb- 3 -rrb- the intra-auricular type of systolic variation , so call from 1 resemblance to intra-auricular pressure curve find in animal , occur in twenty-five clinical case of auricular fibrillation only when ventricular systole be weak ; -lrb- 4 -rrb- double systolic wave , attribute to a systolic tug of the ventricle on the auricle and large vein ; -lrb- 5 -rrb- a systolic impact follow by a stasis wave , present when intravenous pressure be high ; -lrb- 6 -rrb- a regurgitation wave compose of a steep rise continue , attribute to a systolic tug of the ventricle on the auricle and large vein ; -lrb- 5 -rrb- a systolic impact follow by a stasis wave , present when intravenous pressure be high ; -lrb- 6 -rrb- a regurgitation wave compose of a steep rise continue into a systolic plateau with murmur vibration superimpose . we study show -lrb- 1 -rrb- we tricuspid a rare accompaniment of auricular fibrillation , be a rare accompaniment of auricular fibrillation ; and -lrb- 2 -rrb- that the contrary opinion , arrive at by the frequent presence in polygraph tracing of ventricular type of  systolic wave , attribute to a systolic tug of the ventricle on the auricle and large vein ; -lrb- 5 -rrb- a systolic impact follow by a stasis wave , present when intravenous pressure be high ; -lrb- 6 -rrb- a regurgitation wave compose of a steep rise continue , attribute to a systolic tug of the ventricle on the auricle and large vein ; -lrb- 5 -rrb- a systolic impact follow by a stasis wave , present when intravenous pressure be high ; -lrb- 6 -rrb- a regurgitation wave compose of a steep rise continue , be due to the fact that the contour of intensify  systolic wave , attribute to a systolic tug of the ventricle on the auricle and large vein ; -lrb- 5 -rrb- a systolic impact follow by a stasis wave , present when intravenous pressure be high ; -lrb- 6 -rrb- a regurgitation wave compose of a steep rise continue , attribute to a systolic tug of the ventricle on the auricle and large vein ; -lrb- 5 -rrb- a systolic impact follow by a stasis wave , present when intravenous pressure be high ; -lrb- 6 -rrb- a regurgitation wave compose of a steep rise continue be distort by polygraph lever so that the auricle simulate  systolic wave , attribute to a systolic tug of the ventricle on the auricle and large vein ; -lrb- 5 -rrb- a systolic impact follow by a stasis wave , present when intravenous pressure be high ; -lrb- 6 -rrb- a regurgitation wave compose of a steep rise continue , attribute to a systolic tug of the ventricle on the auricle and large vein ; -lrb- 5 -rrb- a systolic impact follow by a stasis wave , present when intravenous pressure be high ; -lrb- 6 -rrb- a regurgitation wave compose of a steep rise continue . recurrent diastolic wave be frequently present in we these record . the auricle relative size depend , to a considerable extent , on the pressure of the tambour . there be no constant relation to similar wave in the record electrocardiogram , nor be no constant relation prove that the auricle be indicative of a coarse type of fibrillation or a associate flutter . 
there may be produce in rabbit by the intravenous injection of large dose of the diphtheria toxin a vascular degeneration involve the entire aorta , the carotid to the base of the skull , the subclavian , and iliac , and , for a vary distance distally , the brachial , femoral , and large abdominal vessel . the first part of the pulmonary artery be sometimes affect . the lesion be practically diffuse throughout the aorta and vessel mention , consist of a fatty degeneration and necrosis of the smooth muscle in a wide zone of the media and a crowd together of the elastic fiber in the region affect , result in a irregular thin of the vessel wall and many small aneurysmal pouching . in rabbit which receive pituitrin with the diphtheria toxin extensive calcification occur throughout this degenerate zone , both in the aorta and vessel mention , consist of a fatty degeneration and necrosis of the smooth muscle in a wide zone of the media and a crowd together of the elastic fiber in the region affect , result in a irregular thin of the vessel wall and many small aneurysmal pouching and other large vessel . it be believe , however , that pituitrin be not essential to the calcification and that if the diphtheria toxin be of any importance the diphtheria toxin be because a extreme fatty degeneration be produce more quickly in the media of other large vessel when a extreme fatty degeneration be administer simultaneously with the diphtheria toxin . the diphtheria toxin , give in large dose of diphtheria toxin intravenously , produce in the kidney of the rabbit a pronounced vascular and parenchymatous degeneration . the former consist of a swell and desquamation of the endothelial cell of the arteriole and small vein with the formation of fibrinous thrombus , a necrosis and thrombosis of the capillary of the tuft with hemorrhage and the formation of fibrinous and hyaline mass , and in some of the affect glomerulus considerable collection of polymorphonuclear leukocyte . 
1 . accessory lobe of thymus , derive from the third pharyngeal pouch , occur in close association with the parathyroid from the third pharyngeal pouch , be find in serial section of the cervical tissue of eleven out of fourteen guinea pig , and probably would have be find in all fourteen but for a technical error . 2 . it be probable , therefore , that accessory lobe of thymus have this situation and origin be usually , if not always , present in the guinea pig . 3 . additional accessory lobe of thymus belong to , but at some distance from the main lobe be also present in several of the animal . 4 . the discovery of additional accessory lobe of thymus belong to , but at some distance from the main lobe make the discovery of   additional accessory lobe of thymus belong to , but at some distance from the main lobe certain that the guinea pig be unsuitable material for complete thymectomy , and probably complete extirpation of the thymus in this animal be rarely , if ever accomplish . 5 . the extirpation experiment of previous investigator in the guinea pig must now be regard as partial extirpation , and previous investigator in   the guinea pig result interpret in that light . 6 . extirpation of the thymus in the guinea pig produce no change in the writer 's experiment . 7 . the study of the serial section of the cervical tissue of the guinea pig indicate that Ruben 's statement regard the parathyroid derive from the fourth pharyngeal pouch in the guinea pig be correct,-that the parathyroid derive from the fourth pharyngeal pouch in   the guinea pig be much smaller than parathyroid III , may be rudimentary , and be sometimes absent at least on one side . 8 . no accessory lobe of thymus be find accompany the parathyroid from the fourth pharyngeal pouch in   the guinea pig , the fourth pharyngeal pouch in   the guinea pig anlarge spring from the fourth pharyngeal pouch in   the guinea pig . 
1 . the inconstant result of past observation on the relation of pituitary extract to renal activity have be due chiefly to unsuitable method . 2 . a standard curve of artificially induce polyuria may be plot for rabbit , give 200 cc . of water by mouth . 3 . extract of the par intermedium and posterior lobe of the hypophysis , give by mouth , subcutaneously , or intravenously , be able definitely to check polyuria thus induce . extract of the anterior lobe show a similar effect , but only to a slight degree . 4 . this antidiuretic effect be constant , and be independent of -lrb- a -rrb- change in blood pressure , -lrb- b -rrb- intestinal absorption , and -lrb- -lrb- c -rrb- -rrb- the vagus . this antidiuretic effect be apparently prevent or delay by division of the splanchnic , and be diminish by division of the renal nerve near the hilus . 5 . a similar antidiuretic property be possess : -lrb- a -rrb- by beta-imidazolylethylamine , -lrb- b -rrb- by p-oxyphenylethylamine , -lrb- c -rrb- by a preparation from secale cornutum , -lrb- d -rrb- by small dose of nicotine , -lrb- d -rrb- by small dose of nicotine of caffeine , and -lrb- f -rrb- by extract of the adrenal cortex . 6 . no effect on artificially induce polyuria be produce : -lrb- a -rrb- by strychnine -lrb- b -rrb- by morphine , -lrb- c -rrb- by adrenalin , or by extract of -lrb- d -rrb- thyroid , -lrb- e -rrb- thymus , -lrb- f -rrb- pineal , -lrb- g -rrb- pancreas , or -lrb- h -rrb- corpus lutea . 7 . in animal under chloral or paraldehyde anesthesia a short and inconstant initial increase in flow of urine be see . 8 . this antidiuretic effect be absent or only slightly marked in check the so call salt diuresis . 
by the tryptic digestion of culture in vitro of avian and mammalian connective tissue , suspension of individual , living cell have be obtain . avian ability to phagocyte carmine and bacterium have be test . the great majority of avian fail to take up either , but a few large cell be able to do so . avian will ingest bacterium only when serum be present ; that be , avian require the interaction of opsonin . there be good reason to suppose that the phagocytic cell be endothelial in nature . should avian prove to be fibroblast , like the other element present , the fact will remain that the phagocytic power of fibroblast be practically negligible . avian failure to ingest foreign matter in vivo be to be lay not to the obstacle offer by the solidity of the tissue avian compose , but to a inherent lack of ability on avian part . the phagocytosis of blood pigment , bacterium , etc. , which take place in granulation tissue in vivo be probably carry on wholly by endothelial cell and wander endothelial cell . 
with the clinical recognition , that different degree of fibrillation occur and that these in turn be closely related to a coordinate type of auricular tachyrhythmium -lrb- flutter -rrb- ; further , that one type may lapse into another or into a perfectly normal rhythm , the conviction have grow that finer and coarser type of auricular movement may be recognize by the amplitude of the diastolic wave of the electrocardiogram , which be the resultant of variation accompany the irregularly spreading excitation wave , and the degree of mass contraction follow and venous pulse . the present investigation into the cause of the diastolic wave of the electrocardiogram and venous pulse have show that this be not possible . there be no theoretical or experimental reason for the assumption that any fixed relation exist between the amplitude of the electrical variation of the electrocardiogram , which be the resultant of variation accompany the irregularly spreading excitation wave , and the degree of mass contraction follow , which be the resultant of variation accompany the irregularly spreading excitation wave , and the degree of mass contraction follow . the large recurrent wave of the venous pulse , which may with more reason be regard as related to the size of the auricular mechanical contraction on theoretical grounds , be also show to be without differential value . the reason for this may be briefly summarize . in the first place , the presence of the diastolic wave of the electrocardiogram and venous pulse be contingent upon a slow heart rate and long ventricular diastole . with rapid heart rate long ventricular diastole occurrence be prevent by the closely place systolic variation . it be therefore conceivable that both coarse and fine fibrillation as well as flutter will be without the diastolic wave of the electrocardiogram and venous pulse as long as the heart be rapid . even in the case with long beat present long ventricular diastole significance must remain doubtful . it be true that in the experiment the wave accompany coarse fibrillation be as a rule somewhat larger than those occur during fine fibrillation ; wave of considerable size may , however , be present in fine fibrillation . hence , as long as no calibrate method of recording be possible , it be difficult to draw any inference . it be possible from the same patient to record with the same apparatus diastolic wave of vary amplitude by merely change the pressure of the receive tambour . the chief reason that the diastolic wave of the electrocardiogram and venous pulse can not be regard as of differential value be find in those occur during fine fibrillation origin . fine fibrillating movement of the auricle do not in those occur during fine fibrillation produce jugular wave . those occur during fine fibrillation produce neither pressure variation in the auricle , nor exert any traction upon the vein . the only factor capable of produce jugular wave during fine fibrillation seem to be the traction exert by the position change of the ventricle on the auricle and large vein . this may , in a measure , explain why the diastolic wave record from the apex and second left interspace of patient often closely correspond with those simultaneously record from the jugular . the term `` fibrillary wave '' commonly apply to the smaller of neither pressure variation in  the auricle , nor exert any traction upon the vein be evidently poorly choose when patient etiology be consider . the coarser contraction of the auricle during coarse fibrillation also produce no pressure change within the auricle . patient be vigorous enough at time , however , to exert a traction upon the venous wall . hence , the wave accompany coarse fibrillation may be regard as partly of ventricular and partly of auricular origin , or , as be frequently the case , as due to a interference of the two traction . the case be owe to patient dual origin that patient be more numerous and distinct when record from the same animal without change the position or pressure of the receive apparatus . 
1 . since we first report on the discovery of the cause of rat-bite fever , we have be able to prove the existence of the same spirochete in five out of six more case which have come under we observation . 2 . the clinical symptom of rat-bite fever be the clinical symptom of rat-bite fever the clinical symptom of rat-bite fever . 3 . the same spirochete in five be present in the swollen local lesion of   and the enlarged lymph gland . but as the spirochete be so few in number it be exceedingly difficult to discover              directly in the material . it be therefore better to inoculate the material into a mouse . in some case the organism be find in the blood of the inoculate animal after a lapse of 5 to 14 day , or at the latest 4 week . 4 . generally speak , the spirochete present thick and short form of about 2 to 5 micro and have the flagellum , too . include the flagellum , too , the inoculate animal after a lapse of 5 to 14 day , or at the latest 4 week measure 6 to 10 micro in length . some form in the culture reach 12 to 19 micro exclude the flagellum , too . the curve be regular , and the majority have one curve in 1 micro . smaller one be find in the blood of the inoculate animal after a lapse of 5 to 14 day , or at the latest 4 week and larger one in the tissue . about 2 to 5 . the spirochete stain easily . with Giemsa 's stain smaller one take a deep violet-red ; smaller one also stain with ordinary aniline dye . the flagellum , too , too , take Giemsa 's stain . 6 . the movement of the spirochete be very rapid , resemble those of a vibrio , and distinguish those of a vibrio from all other kind of the spirochete . when , however , the movement of  the spirochete become a little sluggish , those of a vibrio begin to present the movement of  the spirochete characteristic of ordinary spirochete . 7 . for experimental purpose , mouse , house rat , white rat , and monkey , house rat , white rat , and monkey be mouse , house rat , white rat , and monkey , house rat , white rat , and monkey . monkey have intermittent fever after infection , and the spirochete can be find in monkey the blood of the inoculate animal after a lapse of 5 to 14 day , or at the latest 4 week , but monkey be not so numerous as in the blood of mouse , house rat , white rat , and monkey , house rat , white rat , and monkey . mouse , house rat , white rat , and monkey , house rat , white rat , and monkey be mouse , house rat , white rat , and monkey , house rat , white rat , and monkey , and monkey appear , as a rule , to escape fatal consequence . 8 . the spirochete which we have describe be markedly affect by salvarsan . 9 . the organism be not present in the blood of all rat , and there be no relation between the species of the rat and the ratio of infection . we have never find the spirochete in healthy guinea pig or mouse . by permit a rat infect with the spirochete which we have describe to bite a guinea pig , the latter develop the disease . 10 . we have succeed in cultivate the spirochete in Shimamine 's medium . 11 . among the spirochete describe in the literature or discover in the blood of rat and mouse , there may be some resemble we the same spirochete in five , but none of the description agree with the literature fully . hence we have name we organism spirochaeta morsus muri and regard the literature . 12 . the spirochete which we have describe can be detect in the body of the material . in seven case out of eight , seven disappear on recovery , only to reappear during the relapse . 13 . the spirochete which we have describe can be detect in about 3 per cent of house rat . these fact enable we to identify the cause of the disease . 14 . there may be other cause than the spirochete for disease follow the bite of a rat . the cause of  the disease the cause of  the disease , of rat-bite fever in the form most common in Japan be , we believe , the spirochete which we have describe . 
1 . we have confirm Ogata 's result in experimental rat-bite fever cause by the bite of rat . 2 . in we experiment with guinea pig , the typical symptom , swell of the subcutaneous lymph node , fever , and loss of weight be the typical symptom . the progress of the fever be not so regular as in human case , but we find record in the literature of patient who show irregular fever type or be afebrile . the chief point that we note in the anatomical view of the guinea guinea pig be guinea pig guinea pig . 3 . if a emulsion make from the lymph gland , cerebral substance , or    guinea pig , or the heart 's blood of a guinea pig of the original generation be inoculate subcutaneously or intraperitoneally into a fresh guinea pig , the animal invariably die with the usual symptom of fever and swell of the lymph gland . the anatomical change in this case be the same as those of the original guinea pig , except that the course be shorter and more regular . the same result be observe in further generation . no change be observe in pathogenicity , and in the guinea pig of the original and further generation a species of we spirochete be always observe . the incubation period in the original generation be from 1 to 2 week , and in further generation about 1 week . 4 . when a mouse or white rat be inoculate , spirochete always appear in the peripheral blood , but no other symptom develop . when peripheral blood draw from a mouse thus treat be inoculate into a fresh mouse or a fresh white rat and peripheral blood draw from a fresh mouse or a fresh white rat be inoculate into a fresh guinea pig , further generation about 1 all become infected and the guinea pig of the original and further generation always die . thus we find that rat and mouse be rat and mouse , while guinea pig be both media and victim of  rat and mouse . 5 . in the rhesus monkey on which we make we experiment we witness a process similar to that of human rat-bite fever , and we spirochote be observe in other animal into which blood draw from the rhesus monkey on which we make we experiment be inoculate . 6 . in the original animal spirochete be see chiefly toward the end of a process and the condition as to the period previous to the end of  a process be not yet clearly know . in further generation of all the animal we use , spirochete be find in the peripheral blood 4 or 5 day after inoculation , and gradually multiply until the greate number be reach about the 10th day after inoculation . further generation of all the animal then begin to decrease ; yet spirochete could be observe over 2 month later . 7 . we have find spirochete chiefly in the adrenal of the original animal by Levaditi 's method , but have not yet ascertain further generation of all the animal distribution in other organ . 8 . we spirochete be short , round , and highly motile ; we spirochete stain readily , and have few spiral . we have not yet observe a undulating membrane , but have see what we believe to be flagellum at each end . 9 . the identification of we spirochete with other species must be leave for further study . the spirochete which Futaki , Takaki , Taniguchi , and Osumi find in two patient with rat-bite fever , seem to differ from we in form . 10 . spirochete disappear from the blood of the original animal as a result of the injection of salvarsan , thus indicate that the spirochete which Futaki , Takaki , Taniguchi , and Osumi find in two patient with rat-bite fever be arsentropic . 
we have show in a series of 105 case of pneumonia , 95 of which we have select as available for statistical study , that digitali give by mouth have a action on the heart . we have judge this action to be present because the change occur in the auriculoventricular conduction time and in the form of the t wave of the electrocardiogram , just as they do in the non-febrile heart . this conclusion be strengthen by find that the pulse rate in fibrillate and flutter case fall in the presence of fever , exactly as this conclusion do in the non-febrile case . the dose and the time require to produce these effect be give and be the same as in the non-febrile case . when there be a difference in the amount necessary to produce one or the other of the change , it be find that the t wave of the electrocardiogram be more often and more readily affect than the conduction interval . we have show that the intoxication due to pneumonia be probably not responsible for the change find , both from a study of the statistics and because in the control case reverse tendency be often find -lrb- that be , decrease in conduction time and increase in the size of the t wave of the electrocardiogram -rrb- . we have show that the method of selection in consequence of which we treat a large number of severe case do not prejudice we result , because it could be demonstrate that the proximity of death , whether in control or treat the control case , be not necessarily associate with the change we be describe . we have also , by refer to the literature of the subject , bring evidence to show that heart muscle do not undergo the change in pneumonia , as the literature of the subject do in other infectious disease , which would lead one to expect the change in conduction find in other disease . the change in conduction which have be report by other be almost entirely associate with the give of digitali . 
we feel that the result obtain in the human case and in we animal experiment justify the supposition that magnesium sulphate may be of use in control case of poisoning by strychnine . the human case be a method easily available not only in large hospital but in private practice , and require no elaborate technique . the amount of magnesium sulphate to be use should follow the advice of Meltzer -lrb- 19 -rrb- in tetanus case : intraspinally 1 cc . of a 25 per cent solution to each 20 pound of body weight in adult , and one-half the dose in young child . should this not control the convulsion a small amount of ether may be use . in order to hasten the excretion of strychnine , 200 to 300 cc . of salt solution should be give intravenously . -lrb- 6 -rrb- in the event of the return of the convulsion a small amount of ether may be use , the intraspinal dose may be repeat , always take precaution to keep the head elevated . Meltzer -lrb- 19 -rrb- apparatus for intrapharyngeal insufflation and a 2.5 per cent solution of calcium chloride should always be on hand in case of respiratory failure follow a overdose of the magnesium salt -lrb- Meltzer -lrb- 19 -rrb- -lrb- 19 -rrb- -rrb- . 
sum up these result , we find that all the ten alpha-amino-acid use inhibit the growth of the cell and finally kill the culture . this inhibition be precede by a short period of activity . the typical effect on the cell be show in fig. 1 and 2 . the first -lrb- fig. 1 -rrb- be the first -lrb- fig. 1 -rrb- . the second -lrb- fig. 2 -rrb- be the second -lrb- fig. 2 -rrb- plus asparagine show the cell round off and begin to undergo dissolution . we do not wish to draw too extensive conclusion from these experiment , but we believe that this toxicity have be show beyond a reasonable doubt ; while we have find that the peptone of egg yolk and protein , the peptone of egg yolk and protein , be non-toxic . this toxicity depend upon the concentration and the time that the cell be expose to    this toxicity action . as these factor be reduce , this toxicity be decrease . in this respect , these substance be similar to all cell poison . apply these result to the work do on the intravenous injection of digestion mixture , we believe that we have find a reason for the death of the experimental animal when the hydrolyzed protein be inject too rapidly . Buglia find that large amount of    this toxicity could be inject into the circulation without cause deep-seated change in the renal and intestinal function , provide    this toxicity be inject slowly enough ; in the fact in itself . the intravenous injection of digestion mixture , however , be always accompany by a alpha-amino excretion through the urine and a increase of the peristalsis , of the intestine , with resultant liquid stool . as be well know , a sudden great concentration of these substance in the blood of a animal cause death . these result agree with we finding Folin and Denis demonstrate the fact in itself that    this toxicity probably pass into the circulation through the intestine . Van Slyke 's and Meyer , by means of Van Slyke 's nitrogen method , have practically prove this , and Abel , Rowntree , and Turner , and Abderhalden have lately succeed in obtain alpha-amino-acid in crystalline form from the blood of a animal . Van Slyke 's Meyer have show that the tissue take up the alpha-amino-acid , but that after this the limit of saturation be reach . this be not so in the liver , which continually desaturate this by metabolize the alpha-amino-acid that this have absorb , and consequently maintain indefinitely this power of remove they from  the circulation , as long as they enter   this , which continually desaturate this by metabolize the alpha-amino-acid that this have absorb , and consequently maintain indefinitely this power of remove the alpha-amino-acid from the circulation , as long as the alpha-amino-acid enter this than  the liver , which continually desaturate this by metabolize the alpha-amino-acid that this have absorb , and consequently maintain indefinitely this power of remove they from  the circulation , as long as they enter   this , which continually desaturate this by metabolize the alpha-amino-acid that this have absorb , and consequently maintain indefinitely this power of remove they from  the circulation , as long as they enter   this can metabolize the alpha-amino-acid . Marshall and Rowntree have show that there be a increase of the alpha-amino-acid concentration in the blood after injury to  the liver , which continually desaturate this by metabolize the alpha-amino-acid that this have absorb , and consequently maintain indefinitely this power of remove they from  the circulation , as long as they enter   this , which continually desaturate this by metabolize the alpha-amino-acid that this have absorb , and consequently maintain indefinitely this power of remove they from  the circulation , as long as they enter   this  the liver , which continually desaturate this by metabolize the alpha-amino-acid that this have absorb , and consequently maintain indefinitely this power of remove they from  the circulation , as long as they enter   this , which continually desaturate this by metabolize the alpha-amino-acid that this have absorb , and consequently maintain indefinitely this power of remove they from  the circulation , as long as they enter   this . these experiment prove that tissue cell in general be unable to live in the presence of any great concentration of these acid . at the present time do not feel able to give a explanation of the significance of this evident toxicity . however , the fact in the present time seem to indicate that should expect stimulation from a certain increase of the alpha-amino-acid concentration in the body , or the concentration of any one of the acid , while a greater increase would lead to marked disturbance of the metabolism . 
1 . the resistance of the erythrocyte be increase after splenectomy . 2 . this increase resistance be observe as early as 4 day after splenectomy and usually persist for a period of about 3 week , when the resistance of erythrocyte of dog to the hemolytic activity of cobra venom gradually decrease to normal or slightly beyond . 3 . the decrease of the resistance of erythrocyte be apparently the decrease of resistance to the hemolytic activity of venom for the erythrocyte of splenectomized dog follow the primary increase . a intercurrent infection , such as distemper , tend to reduce the resistance of         the resistance of erythrocyte to venom . 4 . a increase resistance of the erythrocyte to hypotonic salt solution be find with all the splenectomized dog in which these test be make . hypotonic salt solution apparently persist for a longer period than the increase resistance to  the erythrocyte . 5 . as the lysis of the erythrocyte be dependent upon the presence of certain lipoidal substance within the cell , and as the spleen may exercise a influence over the lipoidal contents of corpuscle and serum , it be suggest that the increase resistance of erythrocyte to the hemolytic activity of venom after splenectomy be due to alteration in the lipoid content of the erythrocyte . 
the horse serum , keep for 2 hour at 38 degree c. in the presence of one-fifth 2 hour at 38 degree c. volume of a suspension of 0.5 per cent of pararabin inphysiological salt solution and then free by means of centrifugalization and filtration from the pararabin produce when inject in appropriate dose into a normal rabbit , a considerable and prolonged fall of the blood pressure , a distinct retardation in the coagulation of the carotid blood , and sometimes , in addition , a considerable and prolonged fall of the blood pressure a considerable and prolonged fall of the blood pressure ; a considerable and prolonged fall of the blood pressure . if the horse serum be first heat for 30 minute to 56 degree c. and then treat with pararabin in the manner describe above , the intravenous injection of a normal rabbit exert no more action on the arterial pressure , the arterial pressure , than do normal horse serum when introduce into the vein of a normal rabbit . 
the intoxication which develop as the result of a simple obstruction or a closed intestinal loop be accompany by definite change in the coagulable protein of the blood serum . definite change in the coagulable protein of the blood serum consist essentially in a alteration in the normal albumin-globulin ratio ; the globulin fraction be greatly increase and at time the normal relation of the two fraction may show a complete inversion . the globulin increase be most marked in the animal which show some of the complication meet with in loop animals,-rupture of the loop and peritonitis . in the latter condition especially , the globulin increase be rapid and large . we believe this reaction to be of diagnostic value in acute infection attend by the sudden liberation and absorption of a toxic exudate . infection and intoxication produce by inflammatory irritant be also accompany by a rise in the blood globulin . this observation suggest that tissue disintegration with absorption of toxic product be responsible for definite change in the coagulable protein of the blood serum note , and that bacterial invasion be important only in as far as tissue disintegration with absorption of toxic product give rise to toxic substance . animal which have develop a tolerance to proteose intoxication follow the periodic injection of small dose of proteose do not show a globulin increase . these experiment do not support the view that a expression of a resistance or tolerance develop by the animal be a expression of a resistance or tolerance develop by the animal . from the experimental evidence the experimental evidence seem more probable that the alteration in the partition of the blood protein fraction be one of the result of the metabolic disturbance which have be show to occur in these experimental condition . 
Nomenclature . as mention above , and have many characteristic which distinguish from the other trombidium . these be these of the body , the body and tracheal opening , absence of tracheal capillary . , etc. . the fact that the thumb or the appendage of the palpus do not start from the side of the fourth joint of the latter but from the thumb end , be another charac teristic which do not occur in other trombidium . from the biological point of view two fact should be mention ; the adult female , the adult female do not deposit egg in heap , and in contrast to those of other species , the larvaae hatch out all through the year . from many characteristic which distinguish  from the other trombidium run through all the stage of development , we believe that we be justified in claim a new genus for   . we therefore propose to change the scientific name give to this mite by Brumpt in 1910 , trombidium akamushus , and to introduce instead , accord to the suggestion of Drs. Goto and Watase , the scientific name leptotrombidium akamushus . determinaton of leptotrombidium akamushus , N. sp ,  leptotrombidium akamushus , N. sp , N. sp . the prosopon and the nymph of the tsutsugamushus 1 .

1 . a toxic constituent be present in the fresh pancreas of dog before trypsinogen can have be activate . 2 . the toxic fraction be present in the beta-nucleoprotein , and therefore be thermostable . 3 . 3 be gradually destroy by autolysis but can be obtain in concentrated form from a gland which have autolyze 24 hour . 4 . the toxic material be probably the toxic material . 5 . intravenous or intraperitoneal injection of from 0.05 to o.i gm . per kilo of body weight be usually fatal and elicit in dog symptom comparable to those of spontaneous hemorrhagic necrosis of the fresh pancreas of dog . 6 . dog pancreas differ from that of beef or pig in that guanylic acid and toxic protein combine with dog pancreas be slowly break down by autolysis . 7 . after autolysis of dog pancreas that guanylic acid and toxic protein combine with dog pancreas be slowly break down by autolysis that guanylic acid and toxic protein combine with dog pancreas be slowly break down by autolysis may be separate and obtain in relatively pure form . 
1 . a definite cycle exist in the mammary gland of the non-pregnant guinea pig which correspond to the cycle in the ovary and uterus . a definite cycle can be present through a curve in which the ordinate represent the degree of activity of the gland in a series of animal , and the abscissa the time since ovulation -lrb- period of sexual cycle -rrb- . a curve in which the ordinate represent the degree of activity of the gland in a series of animal , and the abscissa the time since ovulation -lrb- period of sexual cycle -rrb- pass through a first maximum at the time of heat and ovulation and gradually fall . the minimum be reach on the 6th day and continue until the 15th day after ovulation . next begin the period when a new ovulation be imminent and the number of the proliferate gland again increase . we see . then that during the normal cycle the presence of well preserve , function the corpus lutea do not lead to proliferation , neither do mature follicle have such a effect . on the other hand , the absence or degeneration of the corpus lutea be require to insure the mammary gland , which occur during the latter part of     the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation ,        the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation , the condition of   heat and ovulation or during a experimentally prolonged cycle , in case in which the extirpation be not follow at once by   a new ovulation in the first period of the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation . if the first period of the sexual cycle be experimentally prolong , we find in some instance proliferation , while in other the first period of the sexual cycle be absent . as far as we can determine at the present time , two factor seem to favor the proliferation . the connection between good corpus lutea and good deciduorna and the presence of proliferate the mammary gland at this stage of the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation be , however , not absolute . there be case in which a proliferate gland be associate with some degeneration of the corpus luteum . or on the other hand a well preserved corpus luteum be associate with a non-proliferating gland . in some of the latter case the simultaneous presence of a necrotic deciduorna may perhaps explain the lack of proliferation in the mammary gland , which occur during the latter part of     the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation ,        the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation , the condition of   heat and ovulation or during a experimentally prolonged cycle , in case in which the extirpation be not follow at once by   a new ovulation . however , in the majority of the latter case we find the presence of good corpus lutea and good deciduoma associate with a proliferate mammary gland . whether a living corpus luteum as such be able to produce a proliferate mammary gland be as yet doubtful . 2 .   prevent not only the proliferation of the mammary gland , which occur during the latter part of     the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation ,        the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation , the condition of   heat and ovulation or during a experimentally prolonged cycle , in case in which the extirpation be not follow at once by   a new ovulation associate with the first stage of the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation ,   the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation , the condition of   heat and ovulation no longer take place in castrated animal , but in all probability also inhibit the proliferation of the mammary gland , which occur during the latter part of     the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation ,        the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation , the condition of   heat and ovulation or during a experimentally prolonged cycle , in case in which the extirpation be not follow at once by   a new ovulation , or in instance of experimentally prolonged sexual cycle in which well preserve                 be present . 3 . in animal in which    be hypotypical , the mammary gland be in a inactive condition . the presence of hypotypical ovary have the same influence on the mammary gland as castration . in the majority of case , but not in all of these case well preserved corpus lutea be absent . 4 . complete extirpation of the corpus lutea seem directly or indirectly to prevent the secondary proliferation of the mammary gland , which occur during the latter part of     the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation ,        the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation , the condition of   heat and ovulation or during a experimentally prolonged cycle , in case in which the extirpation be not follow at once by   a new ovulation , which occur during the latter part of   the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation ,        the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation , the condition of   heat and ovulation or during a experimentally prolonged cycle , in case in which a proliferate gland be associate with some degeneration of the corpus luteum . this conclusion we consider , however , merely as suggest , not yet as definitely establish through we result . on the other hand , the primary proliferation of     the mammary gland , which occur during the latter part of     the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation ,        the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation , the condition of   heat and ovulation or during a experimentally prolonged cycle , in case in which the extirpation be not follow at once by   a new ovulation , which occur during the latter part of     the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation ,        the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation , the condition of   heat and ovulation or during a experimentally prolonged cycle , in case in which the extirpation be not follow at once by   a new ovulation , during       the first stage of   the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation ,        the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation , the condition of   heat and ovulation , as well as ovulation and the objective sign of heat , during the first stage of   the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation ,        the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation , the condition of   heat and ovulation , as well as ovulation and the objective sign of heat , be accelerate through complete extirpation of the corpus lutea . thus the effect of extirpation of the corpus lutea differ from the effect of castration , in that after the latter neither a new heat nor       the primary proliferation of     the mammary gland , which occur during the latter part of     the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation ,        the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation , the condition of   heat and ovulation or during a experimentally prolonged cycle , in case in which the extirpation be not follow at once by   a new ovulation , which occur during the latter part of     the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation ,        the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation , the condition of   heat and ovulation or during a experimentally prolonged cycle , in case in which the extirpation be not follow at once by   a new ovulation , during       the first stage of   the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation ,        the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation , the condition of   heat and ovulation , as well as ovulation and the objective sign of heat , during       the first stage of   the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation ,        the sexual cycle , the condition of   heat and ovulation , the condition of   heat and ovulation , as well as ovulation and the objective sign of heat occur . as one of the author have point out previously , the absence of function corpus lutea and the presence of either well develop ovarian follicle or of mature follicle be necessary for the occurrence of heat and ovulation . the same condit 
1 . in the pregnant guinea pig proliferation of the mammary gland become regular only at a later stage of pregnancy ; namely , during the period follow the 24th day of pregnancy . previous to this period proliferation be absent in the majority of case . proliferation of the mammary gland during pregnancy become regular only at a period of time which exceed the duration of the normal sexual cycle unaccompanied by pregnancy . it be probable that pregnancy as well as the presence of live deciduorna and corpus lutea increase the proliferative activity of the mammary gland as compare with the ordinary cycle in non-pregnant animal or in animal lack deciduorna and corpus lutea . 2 . after the completion of pregnancy and in the beginning of secretion some mitotic proliferation may still be present , but the completion of pregnancy and in the beginning of secretion soon cease , probably as the result of those process that lead to secretion . while during the period of secretion , notwithstanding the presence of a new pregnancy , mitotic proliferation soon cease , some proliferative stimulus seem still to be active , which , however , under exist condition apparently lead only to a mitotic multiplication of nucleus . the latter conclusion be only suggest at the present time and need confirmation through further study . 3 . in these case ; secretion occur in two animal abort toward the latter part of pregnancy . in one of these case , mitotic proliferation of some gland cell be associate with the microscopic appearance of secretion . 4 . in guinea pig castrate during a early period of pregnancy in which pregnancy continue for some time , these proliferative change be absent in the mammary gland . in conjunction with a partial similar effect observe after extirpation of deciduorna and corpus lutea during pregnancy , we may perhaps attribute the lack of proliferation in some of these case to the absence of the ovary . 5 . extirpation of the corpus lutea during pregnancy induce a new ovulation and with extirpation of the corpus lutea during pregnancy the primary proliferation in the mammary gland ; abortion do not necessarily prevent these proliferative change . the corpus lutea during pregnancy perhaps prevent the secondary proliferative change in the mammary gland . 6 . five injection of cow 's lutein give in relatively large quantity intraperitoneally do not produce proliferation of the mammary gland in the guinea pig . 
the present investigation bring out the fact that the pupil of the cat be little affect by instillation of adrenalin , but show , nevertheless , a greater responsiveness to adrenalin when give intravenously than do that of the rabbit , and that the duration of the dilatation effect by intravenous injection be , on the contrary , longer in the rabbit . in regard to the vasoconstricting effect of adrenalin when administer intravenously , it be find that the intensity as well as the duration of the rise of blood pressure be greater in the rabbit than in the cat . 
1 . microscopical examination of sputum that have be wash with isotonic salt solution indicate sputum that have be wash with isotonic salt solution source . the sputum contain polygonal flat epithelial cell and numerous species of non-pathogenic microorganism .   the sputum be clear of saprophyte , although the sputum sometimes contain bronchoalveolar cuboidal cell . 2 . the source of the sputum can be determine by the erythrocyte and the bacillus that be contain in the source of the sputum , and the site of the lesion can also be ascertain . 3 . in every instance I find the erythrocyte in the pulmonary sputum after severe pulmonary hemorrhage . 4 . six of the case of laryngeal affection refer to in the presentpaper have have no subjective symptom , but microscopical examination show tubercle bacillus in the laryngeal sputum . all the six of the case of laryngeal affection refer to in the presentpaper case be examine by Dr. Tanaka and be find to have tuberculous lesion in the larynx . in the laryngeal sputum of most case of laryngeal tuberculosis with no subjective symptom , tubercle bacillus have be frequently demonstrate , while in some case contaminate laryngeal sputum be obtain only after a long series of examination . 5 . microscopical examination of the sputum play a significant part in the diagnosis of tuberculosis . 
trichomonade from the mouth be study by Steinberg who propose to group trichomonade from the mouth into three distinct type ; namely , trichomonas elongata , trichomonas caudata , and trichomona flagella . 3 regard trichomonade from the mouth as probably identical with Trichomonas homini . opinion differ as to whether or not Donné be Donné . Lynch , for instance , believe that   Donné be Donné , while von Prowazek Bensen 's . Bensen 's view seem to be well support by the difference allege to be find between the mode of encystment in the two trichomonade , be Bensen 's view not for the fact that we knowledge about the so call cyst of the two trichomonade be still obscure . accord to Alexeieff -lrb- 8 -rrb- blastomyce contain in the cell body of  Trichomonas be evidently blastomyce contain in the cell body of Trichomonas . a autogamy allege to take place in    blastomyce contain in the cell body of  Trichomonas as describe by Bohne and von Prowazek -lrb- 9 -rrb- have not be confirm by Dobell -lrb- 10 -rrb- . and Wenyon -lrb- 11 -rrb- contend that 11 have never be find possible to produce any development of    blastomyce contain in the cell body of  Trichomonas outside the body on the warm stage as can be do with    blastomyce contain in the cell body of  Trichomonas . therefore , it be still premature to take the process of encystment into consideration as far as the classification of trichomona be concern . on the other hand , rodenwaldt -lrb- 12 -rrb- seem to think that there be many species of trichomona in the human intestine , and Wenyon -lrb- 11 -rrb- have describe a new trichomona from the human intestine -lrb- macrostoma mesnilus wenyon -rrb- . further cultural study in the morphology and biology of these organism must be carry out in order to solve these problem . in the light of modern investigation there be five subgenera to be include under the genus trichomona Donné . trichomona in the human intestine be as follow : -lrb- 1 -rrb- Protrichomonas Alexeieff , with three anterior flagellum , without a undulating membrane . -lrb- 2 -rrb- trichomastix biitschli -rrb- with three anterior flagellum and a trail flagellum -lrb- schleppgeissel -rrb- without a undulating membrane . -lrb- -rrb- Trichomonas Donné , with three anterior flagellum , without a undulating membrane . -lrb- 4 -rrb- Macrostoma Alexeieff , Amend , 11 Wenyon -lrb- 11 -rrb- , with three anterior flagellum and a undulating membrane wedge in a deep groove -lrb- peristome -rrb- . -lrb- 5 -rrb- Tetratrichomonas Parisi -lrb- 13 -rrb- , with four anterior flagellum and a undulating membrane . as far as we culture trichomona from the human mouth be concern , the human mouth have be show that a new trichomona be not strictly a new trichomona and that a new trichomona should be class under the subgenus Tetratrichomonas . 
1 . the toxic effect of uranium when give in a constant quantity per kilo of body weight be variable . this variation have be constantly associate with difference in the age of the animal . uranium be more toxic for a old animal than for a young animal . the establishment of this fact , namely , that the age of a animal may modify the toxicity of a substance , should be take into account in establish by animal experiment the degree of activity of substance which be to be use for therapeutic purpose . 2 . the toxic effect of uranium nitrate be constantly associate with the toxic effect of uranium nitrate ability to induce a tissue acidosis . a severer grade of acidosis be induce in a old animal from uranium than be induce in a young animal . a severer grade of acidosis would appear that in the response of dog of different age to uranium the animal represent a reaction system to this substance which show a increase susceptibility as the animal advance from youth to senility . insufficient experimental datum be as yet available to allow a discussion of the mechanism by which such a acid intoxication be produce . 3 . the toxic effect of uranium when give in a constant quantity per kilo of body weight be manifest locally by certain degenerative change in the kidney . certain degenerative change in the kidney be more marked in the kidney of a old animal than they be in the kidney of a young animal . associate with the severer kidney change which be especially characterize by a begin swell of the renal epithelium and by a accumulation of stainable fat in these cell be the development of a severe grade of a tissue acidosis . 4 . the functional capacity of the kidney show a parallel with the degree of such a acid intoxication and with the severity of the histological change which have develop in the renal epithelium . 
five culture of bacillus welchius have be study and compare four come from infected wound in the western theatre of war , and one be obtain from a personal article of clothing . each culture possess the essential characteristic ascribe to that group of bacterium . the infectious process cause by the five culture in rabbit , guinea pig , and pigeon , be local in character ; and very few or no bacillus enter or be find in the general blood stream during life or immediately after death . glucose broth culture , inject intravenously , be fatal to rabbit . death occur , almost immediately or after a few hour . agglutinative bacterial embolus have be rule out as the cause of death , as have be a acid intoxication . the fluid part of each culture act in the same manner as the full culture and irrespective of neutralization with sodium hydroxide . the full culture and supernatant fluid be hemolytic when inject directly into the circulation of rabbit , guinea pig , and pigeon , and the acute death produce may be ascribe to a massive destruction of red corpuscle . the passage of the fluid portion of glucose broth culture through Berkefeld filter reduce materially the hemolytic and poisonous effect . culture of the Welch bacillus in plain broth to which sterile pigeon or rabbit muscle be add be highly toxic , and the toxicity be not noticeably diminish by Berkefeld filtration . the filtrate be hemolytic when inject intravenously and inflame and necrotize when inject subcutaneously and intramuscularly . the local lesion produce in the breast muscle of the pigeon closely resemble those cause by infection with the Welch bacillus in plain broth to which sterile pigeon or rabbit muscle be add . the toxicity of the filtrate be not affect by neutralization with sodium hydroxide , but be materially reduce by heat to 62 degree c. and entirely remove by heat to 70 degree c. for 30 minute . successive injection of carefully grade dose of this toxic filtrate in pigeon and rabbit give rise to active immunity . the blood take from the immunized rabbit be capable of neutralize this toxic filtrate . this toxic filtrate have therefore be designate as toxin and the immune serum as antitoxin . the antitoxin neutralize the toxin in multiple proportion . hence the latter would seem to possess the property of a exotoxin . moreover , the latter neutralize the hemolytic as well as the locally . injurious toxic constituent . antitoxic serum prepare from a give culture of bacillus welchius be neutralize for the toxin yield by the other four come from infected wound culture of that microorganism . the antitoxin be protective and curative against infection with the spore and the vegetative stage of bacillus welchius in pigeon . the limit of the protective and curative action be now under investigation . 
the outline which have be give of the relative toxicity of Gréhant 's anesthetic in normal animal , in animal that be nephropathic from uranium and protect against the anesthetic by a alkaline solution , and in those animal which be unprotected by such a solution , furnish the basis for the follow summary . the kidney of the normal dog be relatively non-susceptible to the toxic action of Gréhant 's anesthetic . the kidney have fail to show any change in they histological structure during the period of anesthesia . normal animal have remain diuretic during the period of anesthesia and have respond to diuretic such as theobromine , pituitrin , and solution of urea and sodium chloride . normal animal anesthetized with Gréhant 's mixture for 1 -lrb- 1/2 -rrb- hour usually show at the end of the experiment either no change , or only a slight variation from the normal , in the hydrogen ion content of the alkali reserve before the use of the carbonate the alkali reserve before the use of the carbonate , and in the tension of the carbon dioxide . in several normal dog which be over 4 year of age , by the end of a anesthesia of such a duration the animal that be successfully protect by the carbonate have show a reduction in the alkali reserve before the use of the carbonate and also a decrease from the normal in the carbon dioxide tension of alveolar air . from this observation this observation would appear that even in a normal animal Gréhant 's anesthetic tend to induce a acid intoxication , and as be the case with normal animal which be be intoxicate by uranium , such a intoxication be more readily induce in a old animal than in a young one . the nephropathic animal which have be anesthetized by Gréhant 's anesthetic and in which a attempt have be make to protect these animal against the toxic effect of the anesthetic by the use of asolution of sodium carbonate fall into two clear-cut group . those animal of the series not over 1 -lrb- 1/2 -rrb- 4 year of age old have show at the end of the uranium intoxication and prior to the use of Gréhant 's anesthetic a less severe acid intoxication than have the animal of the series which be over 1 -lrb- 1/2 -rrb- 4 year of age old . in this younger group of animal the intravenous injection of a 3 per cent solution of the anesthetic by the use of asolution of sodium carbonate immediately before the animal that be successfully protect by the carbonate be anesthetized have succeed in protect normal animal against the toxic action of   Gréhant 's anesthetic . during the follow 1 -lrb- 1/2 -rrb- 4 year of age hour of anesthetization normal animal have not develop a severe grade of prior to the use of  Gréhant 's anesthetic a less severe acid intoxication , and in several of the animal at the experiment the alkali reserve before the use of the carbonate be in excess of what the follow    1 -lrb- 1/2 -rrb- 4 year of age be at the uranium intoxication and before a anesthetic be administer . animal of this protected group have remain diuretic throughout the experiment and have show a active diuresis from pituitrin , theobromine , and solution of urea and sodium chloride . the kidney of such animal have show histologically a normal vascular tissue , a normal vascular tissue which give the appearance of be hyperactive , and only occasionally be tubule encounter which show sign of a early epithelial degeneration . the nephropathic animal of the series in which the carbonate solution fail to afford any protection against Gréhant 's anesthetic be the nephropathic animal of the series in which a solution of  the anesthetic by the use of asolution of sodium carbonate fail to afford any protection against   Gréhant 's anesthetic . when these older animal be give intravenously the carbonate solution and be anesthetized , the carbonate solution be find impossible to increase the alkali reserve before the use of the carbonate to the same extent as be possible in the nephropathic animal of the series in which a solution of  the anesthetic by the use of asolution of sodium carbonate fail to afford any protection against   Gréhant 's anesthetic . furthermore , the alkaline solution during the period of anesthesia be rapidly use up so that by the termination of these experiment the animal that be successfully protect by the carbonate may have a alkali reserve of the anesthetic by the use of asolution of sodium carbonate . normal animal have remain completely anuric throughout these experiment and have show no diuretic effect from those diuretic which in the animal that be successfully protect by the anesthetic by the use of asolution of sodium carbonate induce free diuresis . the kidney of these anurus 
a valve be describe for the control of ether vapor for the anesthesia , without change the volume or the pressure at which      be deliver . the regulation of the air stream both to and from the ether bottle control      accurately and be a essential feature of a valve . except for experimental purpose , the regulation of the air stream both to and from the ether bottle be not consider profitable to determine on a arbitrary scale the tension of the ether vapor obtain , because the depth of the anesthesia should always be judge by the condition of the subject . a valve be devise for the meltzer-auer method of intratracheal insufflation , but it be adapt for use wherever a constant mixture of air and ether vapor be desire . several respiration machine for supply and interrupt the air stream , use this constant volume valve for the regulation of the ether supply , have be in use in Dr. Meltzer 's laboratory for period up to 2 year , and the simplicity and efficiency of a valve have be thoroughly test . a description of the complete machine will be publish later . 
1 . culex pipien raise from the larval stage in water experimentally contaminate with a abundance of poliomyelitic virus be find to be incapable of cause the infection when allow in large number to bite normal Macacus monkey . 2 . culex pipien which be feed on infected poloimyelitic monkey during different stage of the disease be find to be incapable of transmit the infection when allow in large number to bite normal Macacus monkey . a previous disturbance of the meninx by a injection of horse serum into the intrathecal space do not alter the result , which be negative . 3 . the offspring of the mosquito which be either rear in the infected tank or feed on infected poloimyelitic monkey be find to be entirely harmless when allow to feed in large number on a normal monkey . there be no hereditary transmission of the virus from one generation to another . 4 . no trace of the virus of poliomyelitis be demonstrable in the filtrate of a emulsion of adult fly and pupa of the common housefly and bluebottle fly which be rear in the laboratory on slice , emulsion , or filtrate of monkey brain contain the poliomyelitic virus . the intracerebral injection of the filtrate of a emulsion of adult fly and pupa of the common housefly produce no poliomyelitic infection in a normal monkey . 
1 . anaerobic method have be devise which depend upon the catalytic action of platinized asbestos upon hydrogen and oxygen . 2 . anaerobic method may be utilize for the growth of anaerobe in test-tube , upon Blake bottle , in flask , and in a large container . 3 . because oxygen be so completely remove , anaerobic method be of great value in the successful cultivation of absolute anaerobe . 
the determination of pneumococcus type in lobar pneumonia be of value in the field of prognosis and as a prerequisite for specific serum therapy . the method for pneumococcus type in lobar pneumonia should be as rapid as possible and a standard technique should be employ . the most satisfactory method be by the intraperitoneal inoculation of a mouse with the patient 's sputum , by which mean a rapid and abundant growth of the pneumococcus be obtain and secondary organism be rapidly eliminate in most instance . the diagnosis of type be make directly on the peritoneal exudate . certain factor in the method commonly use have interfere with the rapid determination of type in a appreciable number of case , notably the growth of other organism in the peritoneal exudate together with the pneumococcus , and some confusion have arise because occasional strain of the pneumococcus have be encounter that show cross agglutination reaction when undiluted immune serum be use . such reaction have be show to be due to a limited zone of non-specific immunity and the pneumococcus invalidate the classification of the pneumococcus into sharply define immunological group . the optimum dilution of serum have be determine that will agglutinate all type strain of the pneumococcus and fail to cause any cross agglutination reaction when mix with equal amount of pneumococcus culture and incubate for i hour at 37 degree c . the pneumococcus be a 1:20 dilution of serum i , a 1:20 dilution of Seruifa II , and a 1:5 dilution of serum iii . for the diagnosis of subgroup Seruifa II pneumococcus undiluted type Seruifa II serum be require . to obviate the other difficulty of the method commonly use commonly use a new method for pneumococcus type in lobar pneumonia have be devise . the method commonly use depend upon the fact that there be produce by the pneumococcus a soluble substance which be present in the peritoneal exudate of the mouse in sufficient quantity to give a specific precipitin reaction with the homologous immune serum . the precipitin method can be use in all instance in which the determination of type by the agglutination method be possible , and the precipitin method possess certain distinct advantage which make the precipitin method available when the agglutination method be impracticable . the precipitin method be of particular value as a time-saving device in most instance where the presence of other organism together with the pneumococcus in the peritoneal exudate cause a delay of 18 hour or more before the type of pneumococcus can be definitely establish . the precipitin method be therefore recommend as the method of choice in all case . if desire , both the agglutination and precipitin method may be apply to the same specimen of peritoneal washing . 
sodium stearate have no effect upon the bacteriological condition of a wound , but the addition of 4 part per 1,000 of chloramine-t render the addition of 4 part per 1,000 of chloramine-t antiseptic . experiment i enable we to compare the action of sodium stearate contain    1,000 of chloramine-t  4 part per 1,000 of chloramine-t alone with that of sodium stearate contain 1,000 of chloramine-t 4 part per 1,000 of chloramine-t . wound which have be previously sterilize could be maintain in a aseptic condition by 1,000 of chloramine-t , although in some case reinfection occur -lrb- experiment 2 , 3 , and 5 -rrb- . for this reason the concentration of chloramine-t be increase . surface wound , deep-seated surface wound , and osseous cavity , which have previously be either completely or almost completely sterilize , could be maintain for day and even week in a condition of surgical asepsis by the use of a condition of surgical asepsis by the use of a paste contain 7 and 10 part per 1,000 of chloramine-t . experiment 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , and 12 be experiment 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , and 12 . slightly infected wound -lrb- experiment 9 , ii , and and 12 -rrb- be sterilize in the same manner . next , it be attempt to sterilize severely infected wound . this attempt be probably successful because the wound use for experiment 9 , ii , and and 12 show but slight quantity of the secretion and only a shallow layer of necrotic tissue . it be useless to attempt to sterilize severely infected wound with a condition of surgical asepsis by the use of a condition of surgical asepsis by the use of a paste , for the volume of the chloramine-t be too limited . a large volume of a active substance be require to sterilize a wound which secrete great quantity of pus , for owing , on the one hand , to the dilution of this substance with the secretion , and , on the other , to the one hand combination with the protein contain in the pus , the concentration of the antiseptic be rapidly diminish . for these reason it be essential that the antiseptic solution should be constantly renew , so that the concentration of the antiseptic may be sufficiently strong to effect the destruction of the bacterium . therefore , the chloramine-t paste can not sterilize a severely infected wound . the concentration of a active substance contain a condition of surgical asepsis by the use of a condition of surgical asepsis by the use of a paste must at the same time be sufficiently weak to be innocuous to the tissue . we have see that the concentration of   a active substance should not exceed 15 part per 1,000 of chloramine-t . thus , it be evident that if the secretion from severely infected wound be abundant , a active substance could exert a active substance the action of sodium stearate upon the microorganism for the space of only a few hour . for this reason the chloramine paste should only be apply under the condition specify in we experiment 9 , ii , and and 12 ; we be , in connection with moderately infected wound which have be carefully wash with sodium oleate , and possess but slight quantity of secretion . under the condition specify in we experiment 9 , ii , and and 12 , the chloramine paste effect the complete disappearance of the bacterium and maintain the sterility thus secure for as long a time as may be wish . if the technique follow in the dress be not exactly as above describe , reinfection will occur . if apply in the same manner the chloramine paste be not injurious to the tissue , for the cicatrization curve of the wound thus treat show but slight modification from the calculate curve . chloramine paste make the same manner possible , therefore , to keep surface wound sufficiently free from the microorganism for the space of only a few hour so that the effect of substance which be believe to influence cicatrization can be study . 
1 . diphtheria toxin of known strength , inject intravenously into rabbit in single dose , produce lesion which be first evident in the endothelium of the tuft , and possibly in the intertubular capillary . 2 . the lesion of greatest severity with medium dose be also find in the tuft . 3 . evidence be present to show that epithelial damage in the tuft and especially in the tubule be secondary to the vascular injury . 4 . the severity of the lesion of greatest severity with medium dose be roughly proportional to the amount of toxin inject . hemorrhage do not occur with dose of less than 0.0023 cc . of toxin per kilo of body weight and be not extensive with dose of less than 0.004 cc . per kilo . 5 . it be suggest that the localization of the tuft be due to the concentration of toxin in the blood that follow the loss of water at this point . 6 . it be further suggest that this inference may be extend to explain the pathogenesis of the so call intracapillary form of glomerulonephritis . 
1 . rabbit in which a mild grade of glomerular damage have be produce by small dose of diphtheria toxin develop a severe glomerulonephritis correspond to the extracapillary form describe by Volhard and Fahr after inoculation with sublethal quantity of bacillus coli . 2 . similar , though not completely identical lesion be produce when diphtheria toxin be follow by intravenous injection of Vaughan 's split protein -lrb- poisonous part -rrb- of bacillus coli . 3 . the inference be draw that under the experimental condition describe bacillus coli undergo bacteriolysis and produce glomerular lesion through the toxic group contain within bacillus coli protein molecule . 
the work of previous investigator give the impression that it be easy to produce serum which both in vitro and upon injection be leukotoxic . at the same time the specificity of these leukotoxic serum for the particular type of cell use as antigen , and even for leukocyte in general , have be doubtful . the method use have make certain possible factor of error unavoidable . even careful wash of a organ or suspension can not render even careful wash of a organ or suspension wholly blood-free , so that it be not surprising that these leukotoxic serum for the particular type of cell use as antigen , and even for leukocyte in general should be moderately hemolytic and hemagglutinative . Pearce have show that the injection of very small amount of blood be sufficient to evoke the production of immune hemolysin . when such serum be inject the lesion , as Pearce state , may be due in part to the production of hemagglutinative thrombus , although this hardly seem to apply to the change in lymphoid tissue describe by Flexner . on the other hand , the lymphotoxic effect of hemolytic serum may be due to the lymphocyte inject with the red cell . we own experiment indicate that the lymphotoxic and agglutinative factor be to a considerable degree distinct from the hemolytic and hemagglutinative one , since the hemolytic and hemagglutinative one can be separate from one another by absorption . further evidence be present that the small thymus cell be biologically relate to , if not identical with the lymphocyte inject with the red cell derive from lymph gland . 
1 . the result of increase resistance to the excretion of urea through the kidney , in the sense of a relatively increase concentration in the blood , be the result of the increase resistance . 2 . the relatively increase concentration of urea in the blood overcome the increase resistance to excretion , and the organism be thereby maintain in nitrogenous equilibrium . 3 . Ambard 's Ambard 's law apply in the condition of the result of increase resistance to the excretion of urea through the kidney under a widely vary range of condition , as to nitrogen intake and excretion . 4 . the numerical value of Ambard 's constant change in the result of increase resistance to the excretion of urea through the kidney , but the relation of the variable factor to one another remain otherwise unchanged . 5 . in certain individual , with otherwise normal finding in regard to     , a unusual degree of constancy , to which we have apply the term fixation , have be find in the numerical result obtain by the application of Ambard 's law . certain individual be regard , as the result of this study , as probably abnormal , but the pathological significance of the term fixation have not be determine . 
the intratracheal injection of one moderate dose of adrenalin in rabbit whose vagus be divide produce a marked pulmonary edema in a large percentage of case . the same dose in normal animal cause only slight effect . artificial respiration greatly reduce the production of pulmonary edema in vagotomized rabbit after adrenalin . as adrenalin can exert a bronchoconstrictor effect , evidence be submit to show that the aspirate action of the lung alveolus under this condition apparently play a important part in the production of adrenalin pulmonary edema . on the basis of this mechanism the protective action of artificial respiration be explain . stenosis of the trachea facilitate . the production of adrenalin pulmonary edema in vagus rabbit whose vagus be divide . the intratracheal injection of adrenalin in vagotomized rabbit produce a temporary incoordination between the heart ventricle , visible on inspection , so that the left ventricle beat apparently half as fast as the right , cause hyperemia of the lung and hemorrhage . Atropine inject intratracheally in vagotomized rabbit exert a protective action against adrenalin pulmonary edema . 
with the purpose of determine whether a diminish activity of the bone marrow could be bring about experimentally , plethora be produce in rabbit by means of repeat small transfusion of blood . count of the number of reticulated red cell in the circulate blood be make during the course of the experiment as a index to change in the bone marrow . with the development of plethora , the circulate blood decrease . in the majority of the plethoric animal , this diminution be extreme , and in some instance , the reticulated cell practically disappear from the circulate blood . a comparison of the red bone marrow of these animal with that of normal control reveal a marked reduction in the content of the reticulated cell . after a number of transfusion , there occur in some of the plethoric rabbit a sudden and marked drop in hemoglobin . the hemoglobin continue to fall until a severe grade of anemia be reach . this be follow by a extremely rapid regeneration accompany by a striking rise in the color index . during regeneration , the reticulated cell be enormously increase in number . take together , these fact show that the bone marrow be markedly influence by plethora . the diminish number of reticulated cell observe , both in the circulate blood and in the bone marrow , would make the diminish number of reticulated cell observe , both in   the circulate blood and in  the bone marrow appear that a decide decrease in blood production occur . the reduction in the number of reticulated red cell in the circulate blood can not be due to change in the constitution of the red cell put out by the bone marrow , as a result of a increase quantity of hemoglobin in the body , because during regeneration from the above mention the anemia , the reticulated cell be still present in large number . that the bone marrow do actually diminish during plethora be further evidence by the occurrence of the anemia . the most reasonable explanation of this phenomenon be that the recipient develop a immunity against the blood of the donor ' , which result in the destruction of the strange cell that be in circulation . in keep with this conception be the appearance of isoagglutinin for the donor ' red cell in the blood of the recipient , at about the time of the begin fall in hemoglobin . the occurrence of anemia as a result of the destruction of the alien blood only would seem to be due to the circumstance that , during the period of plethora , blood production be greatly diminish ; as a consequence , the blood cell proper to the recipient be gradually reduce in number and replace by alien cell until the latter come to constitute the bulk of the animal 's blood . in the plethoric rabbit develop anemia , the initial drop of hemoglobin from the plethoric level to the normal be constantly accompany by a marked rise in the diminish number of reticulated cell observe , both in   the circulate blood and in  the bone marrow . this bring up a subsidiary problem for study . with the idea that the stimulation of the bone marrow might be due to the presence of a increase quantity of break down blood , rabbit , be inject intravenously with large amount of laked blood cell . the procedure have no evident effect on the blood picture . it be then find that simple blood removal from a plethoric animal which bring back the hemoglobin to the plethoric level to the normal , or even to a point somewhat above , suffice to cause a marked increase in the diminish number of reticulated cell observe , both in   the circulate blood and in  the bone marrow . although these finding be not conclusive , they suggest a explanation for the increase bone marrow activity accompany the initial drop of hemoglobin in the plethoric rabbit ; namely , that the organism have in some way adapt the initial drop of hemoglobin in the plethoric rabbit ; namely , that the organism have in some way during the period of plethora to the presence of a greater amount of blood and that the result of blood loss in such a organism be a relative but not absolute anemia . the finding that the bone marrow can be depress by the introduction of a large quantity of blood into the circulation account for the diminish bone marrow activity which sometimes occur after transfusion in pernicious anemia . in such case there be a marked drop in the diminish number of reticulated cell observe , both in   the circulate blood and in  the bone marrow 
the experiment report above give evidence that in unresolved lobar pneumonia , the persistence of the exudate , follow by organization , depend upon the presence of serum in the exudate . 
1 . the growth . energy of the granulosa cell in the ovarian follicle of normal guinea pig ovary vary with the size of the follcle , and follow a definite growth curve . the growth energy in small follicle be relatively low , then a gradual rise take place with increase in size of the follicle up to a maximum which be reach when the follicle attain medium size . this ascend part of a definite growth curve be follow by a gradual fall in the growth energy in small follicle until in large follicle the proliferative power which be proportionate to the extent of the degeneration have fall almost to the level of small follicle . synchronously with maturity of large follicle there be a abrupt fall in the growth energy in small follicle to near the zero point . 2 . there be a distinct localization of mitosis in the follicle . the large majority of mitosis in  the follicle be find in the perioval part . with increase in the growth energy which characterize medium follicle , there be a increase in the proliferative power of the granulosa cell in the ovarian follicle of normal guinea pig ovary more distal to the egg , but still near the egg . we may therefore conclude on the basis of we observation and on the previous observation of Loeb , that the egg exert a stimulus , which cause proliferation of the granulosa cell in the ovarian follicle of normal guinea pig ovary . 3 . under pathological condition certain change occur in the growth energy of the follicle : -lrb- a -rrb- granulosa degeneration cause in the living cell a diminution in the proliferative power which be proportionate to the extent of granulosa degeneration . -lrb- b -rrb- hypotypical follicle have approximately the same or only slightly diminish proliferative power as normal one , and thus normal one failure to grow be essentially due to disintegration of the granulosa cell in the ovarian follicle of normal guinea pig ovary . 
the age incidence of focal tuberculous lesion of the lung demonstrate that they have they origin in most instance in childhood . focal lesion which heal have be find at all age after the 2nd year of life , but in more than half of all individual focal lesion which heal be acquire between the age of 10 and 18 year . in the period between 18 and 30 year at least 85 per cent of all individual have ` acquire focal tuberculous lesion of the lung . the occurrence of tuberculous infection in the lung , in the regional lymphatic node , or in some other organ of the body such as the gastrointestinal tract and the occurrence of tuberculous infection in  the lung lymphatic system , be nearly universal but doubtless a few individual escape . that focal tuberculous lesion of the lung be occasionally acquire during adult life be show by the slight increase in the proportion of those with focal lesion which heal as age increase from 18 year to old age . apical lesion of the lung make that focal tuberculous lesion of the lung be occasionally acquire during adult life appearance in later childhood and occur with increase frequency from adolescence to old age -lrb- 50 per cent -rrb- . after the 2nd year of life focal tuberculous lesion occur in situation other than the apex of the lung tend to heal and after the 10th year focal tuberculous lesion occur in situation other than the apex of  the lung be almost invariably encapsulate and latent or heal . fatal tuberculosis after the 10th year be with few exception apical in origin . the apex of  the lung be not only more susceptible to infection in later life but once infected afford less resistance to the extension of the lesion . the present series of case have furnish opportunity to observe the character of the apical lesion in lung of individual previously infect with tuberculosis . with one exception the apical lesion -lrb- in eight instance -rrb- have pursue a chronic course and , encapsulate by fibrous tissue , have remain limited to the extreme apex of the lung . in one instance in a woman with advanced malignant disease chronic pulmonary tuberculosis have be progressive . tuberculosis of the apex in those who have previously acquire a focal tuberculous lesion have pursue a chronic course and in most instance have remain latent or have completely heal . a very small group of instance of fatal pulmonary tuberculosis suggest that apical lesion in those who have previously acquire a focal tuberculous lesion have pursue   a chronic course may assume a unusually severe character . one instance of apical tuberculosis unaccompanied by focal tuberculous lesion occur in situation other than the apex of  the lung and follow by tuberculosis of the thoracic duct and disseminate miliary tuberculosis have be especially significant . apical tuberculosis unaccompanied by evidence of preexist tuberculosis may be accompany by tuberculosis of the regional lymphatic node , whereas apical tuberculosis in a individual with a preexistent focal tuberculous lesion be not follow by tuberculosis of adjacent lymphatic node . it be well know that tuberculosis in previously uninfected animal be follow by tuberculosis of adjacent lymphatic node , whereas a second infection fail to implicate the regional lymphatic node . this relation have be well illustrate by the lung of a monkey which acquire in confinement acute tuberculous pneumonia limit to the left lung ; the lymphatic node on this side be greatly enlarged and caseous . the follow observation indicate that apical tuberculosis of adult be not the result of infantile tuberculosis but be cause by subsequent infection : -lrb- a -rrb- apical tuberculosis do not have the result of infantile tuberculosis highest incidence , in accordance with common belief , in early adult life when focal infection acquire in childhood be relatively fresh and active but be more common in later life when the focal lesion of childhood have in most instance completely heal . it be noteworthy that most of these apical lesion of later life pursue a chronic course and be discover at autopsy in individual who have die from other cause . -lrb- b -rrb- the well characterize lesion of tuberculosis acquire in childhood and find in adult with these apical lesion of later life be almost invariably calcify and heal . the apical lesion be in most instance relatively fresh and caseous whereas the focal pulmonary lesion and associum 
in the study of the action of non-antiseptic substance on the rate of cicatrization , the chief obstacle encounter be the wound the chief obstacle encounter . at the beginning of experiment 1 the wound be sterile . the beginning of experiment 1 be subject to flush with distilled water for 2 hour , then 4 hour , then to flush with 30 per cent sodium chloride solution for another 2 hour . during that time no special precaution be take to sterilize the wound and the dress be leave intact until the follow morning . it be then find that the wound contain from 30 to 50 bacterium per field . the follow day , after the wound have be subject to the same treatment , the number of bacterium have increase to 50 per field , and as a immediate consequence the surface of the wound increase from 12 to 12.6 sq. cm . in 2 day . the wound be then dress antiseptically and be find to be sterile 3 day later . reinfection again take place the follow day in spite of antiseptic dress with chloramine paste 4 part per 1,000 , which be apply for 20 hour . in experiment 2 similar result be observe . after 2 day of flush with distilled water , the number of bacterium have increase to 50 per field . the wound be thereupon sterilize , but new reinfection ensue a few day later . another wound on the same patient become reinfect under the same condition after 1 day of sterile dress . in none of the patient could the wound be keep in a sterile condition throughout the whole experiment . it be impossible to maintain the sterility of a wound under   the chief obstacle encounter . Dakin 's solution be therefore inject every 4 hour , or less often , accord to the degree of infection , or chloramine paste be apply during the night . if there be and 3 or 4 bacterium per field , the whole experiment be discontinue in order that the wound might be sterilize again . the cicatrization and bacteriological curve of experiment 4 show that by the application of chloramine paste a wound may be maintain in a appropriately bacteriological condition for carry out a experiment . nevertheless , in spite of the antiseptic precaution take , it be necessary to interrupt this experiment on two occasion , on December 13 to 15 and on December 18 to 22 , in order that a complete sterilization of the wound might be effect . when a complete sterilization of  the wound be perform as soon as and 3 or 4 bacterium per field be discover , little retardation occur in the process of cicatrization . moreover , the reinfection from the skin be often due to fine bacillus which have but mild retard action on the rate of healing . the use of at least six flushing in 2 hour with Dakin 's Dakin 's solution or of 12 hour ' dress with chloramine paste 10 part per 1,000 , be necessary to keep the wound in a condition of surgical asepsis . the action of distilled water be study in experiment 1 , 2 , and 3 . in experiment 1 the wound be subject to flush with distilled water first for 2 hour , then 4 hour , then  2 hour , then 4 hour , then 4 hour , and later for 8 hour per 1 day of sterile dress . the wound be maintain in a condition of mild infection . no marked modification , either acceleration or retardation , be note in the rate of repair during the period that the same treatment be apply . from November 21 to 25 the wound be almost clean and the observe curve remain parallel to the calculate curve , show that distilled water do not retard the rate of healing . in experiment 2 the wound be subject to uninterrupted flushing with distilled water , first for 8 hour , then for 24 hour . experiment 2 be continue from November 24 to 30 per cent sodium chloride solution for another 2 hour ; viz. , for 112 hour out of 120 , without the occurrence of any marked modification of the course of healing . the bacteriological curve show that from November 22 to 27 inclusive the wound be keep aseptic . the slight retardation which occur afterwards be probably bring about by the infection . in experiment and 3 the wound be subject to flush with distilled water , first for 2 , then for 4 , 6 , and 8 hour , a total of 20 hour in 4 day . from November 21 to 24 the wound remain surgically aseptic . no modus

Streptococci inject into the circulation of cat be quickly withdraw and be find most numerously in the lung , less numerously in the liver and spleen , and in small number in the bone marrow , lymph node , muscle , and kidney . 2 . the streptococcus take up by the lung be kill within 5 to 8 hour , although cat be quickly withdraw remain visible in film for a number of day . in the liver cat be quickly withdraw be kill less rapidly , and in the spleen a few may remain viable for a considerable period . 3 . this bactericidal action may be demonstrate in piece of excise lung but not in lung extract , and be apparently dependent on the action of the living cell . 4 . Streptococci inject into a susceptible animal , a susceptible animal , be also promptly remove from the circulation of cat be quickly withdraw , but be distribute in different proportion , the liver and spleen absorb almost as many as the lung , and the muscle also take up a appreciable number . 5 . as in the cat , the organism take up by the lung and liver of the living rabbit be promptly kill . those which lodge in the muscle , however , multiply rapidly . 6 . about the time that Streptococci have begin to develop in the muscle -lrb- 4 to 8 hour after injection -rrb- the number in the blood stream begin to increase . 7 . the increase in the blood stream be not due to exhaustion of the mechanism of they removal nor have these organism acquire a resistance sufficient to maintain they in the blood stream of a normal animal . the resuit of wash out of organism from the infected tissue , then , be probably the resuit of wash out of these organism acquire a resistance sufficient to maintain they in the blood stream of a normal animal from the infected tissue . 8 . attempt to immunize rabbit have be unsuccessful , but in certain treated animal the distribution of the organism among the various organ approach that find in insusceptible animal ; i.e. , i.e. . 
the total capacity , middle capacity , and residual air have be determine in twenty adult woman suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis . the chest volume have be determine in each case and the normal lung volume calculate by means of the ratio work out in paper i and apply to thirty-one man in paper ii . the excursion of the diaphragm have be determine by fluoroscopy in all case . of eight patient with incipient tuberculosis , five have lung capacity like those of man in the same group ; i.e. , about normal total capacity , slightly increase residual air , and consequently somewhat decrease vital capacity . three have considerably diminish total capacity . in these three patient , however , clinical abnormality be find -lrb- extensive miliary tuberculosis , obstruction of bronchus , fixation of diaphragm in expiratory position -rrb- . in twelve patient with moderately advance and advance tuberculosis , the result agree with those find in man in the same group ; i.e. , the total capacity and vital capacity be decrease , while slightly increase residual air be practically normal . 
1 . Dakin 's hypochlorite solution have the power of dissolve necrotic tissue , pus , and plasma clot in the concentration and reaction use clinically . 2 . chloramine-t and dichloramine-t do not exhibit this action . 3 . the solvent action of Dakin 's hypochlorite solution of the degree of alkalinity use clinically be due primarily to the solvent action of  Dakin 's hypochlorite solution of the degree of alkalinity use clinically hypochlorite content , but the solvent action of  Dakin 's hypochlorite solution of the degree of alkalinity use clinically slight alkalinity , while in the solvent action of  Dakin 's hypochlorite solution of the degree of alkalinity use clinically slight alkalinity without solvent action , enhance the effectiveness of the hypochlorite . 4 . in alkalinity use clinically , the solvent action of  Dakin 's hypochlorite solution of the degree of alkalinity use clinically be absent below about 0.2 per cent sodium hypochlorite concentration . 5 . the hypochlorite concentration at which the solvent action of  Dakin 's hypochlorite solution of the degree of alkalinity use clinically cease be lower the hypochlorite concentration at which   the solvent action of  Dakin 's hypochlorite solution of the degree of alkalinity use clinically cease , and vice versa . 6 . none of the antiseptic study have demonstrable solvent action on blood clot . 
in two instance of common cold , with no known contact with case of pneumonia , pneumococcus type i be find to be the predominate organism , which strongly suggest that the predominate organism be the etiological agent in common cold . if this be so , common cold of pneumococcus type i must be look upon as a possible source of contagion in the development of lobar pneumonia due to the type i pneumococcus . 
the result of we experiment do not substantiate in full the theory of the power of selective action of streptococcus viridan . a few strain show a remarkable constancy in location and type of lesion , but a few strain be greatly in the minority . the location of the lesion in animal seem to bear no relation to the origin of the organism or to the lesion produce by no relation in the patient from which the strain be obtain . streptococcus viridan , regardless of site of origin in the patient from which the strain be obtain , produce most lesion in the heart and joint . 
the subcutaneous injection of 1 or 2 mg . of morphine sulfate per kilo subcutaneously in dog with a pancreatic deficiency , whose sugar tolerance be still good , produce a rise in the glycemia about four time greater than the same amount of morphine call forth in normal dog . as dog with a pancreatic deficiency due to coagulation or partial resection of the gland may legitimately be consider in a prediabetic state , the inference be warrant that the morphine test may be of value in detect a weakened carbohydrate metabolism in the human subject . the morphine test could easily and without danger be carry out with the micro method now available for the quantitative determination of blood sugar . the experimental fact describe in this paper give additional corroboration to the view that the response of a normal and of a pathologically altered organism to the same drug in the same dosage may be quantitatively very different . 
1 . the total capacity , middle capacity , and residual air have be determine in 31 adult male patient suffer from tuberculosis of the lung . 2 . the chest volume have be determine in each case and the normal lung volume calculate by means of the ratio work out in a previous paper . 3 . in nine patient with incipient tuberculosis , the total lung volume be find within normal limit , whereas the vital capacity be diminish as a result of a increase residual air . the increase in a increase residual air be due to less complete expiration , cause partly by the diminish movement of  the diaphragm , partly by diminish compression of the chest wall . the diminish movement of the diaphragm be , as a rule , most mark on the most affected side . whether these decrease movement be due to a reflex or to stiffness of the lung tissue we could not determine . the middle capacity , on which we do not want to put too much stress be find practically normal . 4 . in twenty-two case of moderately advance , and advance tuberculosis , the total lung volume be in most case markedly decrease . the vital capacity be substantially decrease , principally as a result of the diminish total capacity . a increase residual air be , as a rule , normal , although in a few case a increase in residual air also contribute to the decrease in the vital capacity . the middle capacity , on which we do not want to put too much stress , on which we do not want to put too much stress , be normal in some patient and considerably diminish in other . 
some hypothetical conclusion bear on the evolution of cicatricial tissue can be suggest . the arterial circulation deposit in the wound chemical substance necessary for contraction of the wound and for epithelial proliferation . when the biologic process be not hinder by any special or severe bacterial infection this deposit be as regular as the circulation the biologic process , and enable we to determine in advance the date of cicatrization . it even seem as though when the epidermization process be retard by a slight infection the substance necessary for epidermization be store up in the wound , and when the delay due to infection be remove only the epithelium find a accumulation of nutritive substance , and , so to speak , make up the lose time . moreover , when a infection entirely or partially stop epidermization , we have observe -lrb- experiment 3 , 4 , and 5 -rrb- we after a infection have disappear the progress of new epidermization be much more rapid than normally ; a infection even pass the calculated curve . a infection apparently destroy only the epithelium and leave in the wound the chemical substance which activate epidermization . the existence of these physical or chemical activate agent have be indicate again by two anatomical clinical fact . in treat a scalp wound in which there have be practically no epidermization for many month , we apply over the entire surface of the sterile wound dermo-epidermic graft of fetal skin . after apparently take , dermo-epidermic graft of fetal skin be absorb and disappear , but epidermization of the periphery of the wound , which hitherto have not progress , take place abundantly , almost a hundred time as much as before . we believe that by mathematical measurement we can solve the problem of the action of various organic fluid on the cicatrization of wound . 
1 . thirty-one determination of the total oxygen-combining power and the oxygen in the venous blood from vena mediana cubitus of sixteen rest patient be report . 2 . the difference between the total oxygen capacity of the hemoglobin and the oxygen in the venous blood from vena mediana cubitus of sixteen , the venous blood from vena mediana cubitus of sixteen , be calculate . 3 . in twelve patient with compensate heart lesion the venous blood from vena mediana cubitus of sixteen be find within normal limit , between 2.5 and 8 volume per cent . 4 . in four patient with incompensated heart disease the value for the venous blood from vena mediana cubitus of sixteen be all above the normal limit , from 9.7 to 15.2 volume per cent . 5 . a general discussion of the problem of interpret the result be give . 6 . a comparison be draw between the oxygen consumption calculate from direct determination of the blood flow on a normal subject -lrb- the writer -rrb- and the oxygen unsaturation determine 4 year later on the same subject . a close agreement between the two series of the value for  the venous blood from vena mediana cubitus of sixteen exist . 
1 . forty-six determination of the oxygen unsaturation , i.e. , forty-six determination of the oxygen unsaturation , i.e. forty-six determination of the oxygen unsaturation , i.e. , have be do in five patient with compensate circulatory disturbance . 2 . value within normal limit and near or below the normal average be find in four patient with regular pulse . 3 . in one patient with mitral insufficiency and arrhythmium perpetua extremely vary value be encounter . six determination be make ; in one instance the value be within normal limit , in five above , and in one of those even higher than in most case of incompensated heart lesion . 4 . a comparison be draw between the directly determine oxygen unsaturation in four patient with regular pulse and the oxygen consumption calculate from previous experiment by the writer , where the blood flow be determine directly by the nitrous oxide method . a close parallelism be find . 
1 . a report be make of 103 determination of the oxygen unsaturation of the venous blood of five patient with incompensated heart disease . 2 . value for the oxygen unsaturation within normal limit be find only under two circumstance : -lrb- a -rrb- in a stage of full compensation , and -lrb- b -rrb- in a stage of incompensation , -lrb- b -rrb- during compensation just before the clinical symptom of incompensation have develop , and -lrb- c -rrb- at time in five patient with incompensated heart disease . 3 . value above the upper normal extreme be meet with under three circumstance : -lrb- a -rrb- during incompensation , -lrb- b -rrb- during compensation just before the clinical symptom of incompensation , -lrb- b -rrb- during compensation just before the clinical symptom of incompensation have develop , and -lrb- c -rrb- at time in five patient with incompensated heart disease , and -lrb- c -rrb- at time in five patient with incompensated heart disease with auricular fibrillation in a condition of complete and stable compensation . 4 . a comparison have be draw between the directly find value for the oxygen unsatilration and the value for the oxygen consumption calculate from previous experiment by the writer on the blood flow -lrb- minute volume of the heart -rrb- , in patient with similar clinical condition . a close agreement exist . 5 . it seem probable from we experience with patient under digitali therapy that the oxygen unsaturation within normal limit afford , a objective criterion of the positive effect of digitali therapy . 
1 . increase in circulatory rate cause by hard exercise have no power to dislocate nucleated red cell from the bone marrow either in normal , in anemic , in hyperplastic , or in anemic and hyperplastic animal . 2 . in anemic and hyperplastic animal pseudocrise of nucleated red cell can be produce at certain period by hard exercise , but careful analysis lead inevitably to the conclusion that a more accurate expression of circulatory content at the time of the procedure be merely a more accurate expression of circulatory content at the time of the procedure . 3 . section of the vasomotor nerve to the four limb with consequent dilatation of the marrow vessel and increase blood flow through the tissue do not result in the free of nucleated red cell from the bone marrow . 
that a definite change in the reactivity of the skin that take place during the transition period take place during the transition from infancy to childhood have be repeatedly note . Rolly -lrb- 5 -rrb- , work with a variety of bacterial toxin , find that infant do not react , but that reaction occur with advance age . similarly Tenner -lrb- 6 -rrb- , use Witte 's peptone , colon bacillus , and tuberculin observe that at about the period that the skin of child become increasingly sensitive to tuberculin , a corresponding reactivity be manifest toward the other antigen . it seem possible to we that this phenomenon be relate to the alteration in the ferment of the skin that take place during the transition period . thus while the protease of the adult type of skin cause a definite autolysis , that of the fetal skin do not , the synthetic potential evidently predominate . of greater significance seem to be the fact that the skin of the young animal contain peptidase to a considerable amount , while the adult skin seem to be without this ferment activity . if we assume that the disintegration of the native protein of the antigen be essential in elicit certain skin test , the disintegration of the native protein of the antigen would seem probable that the splitting would be less apt to take place in the young skin in which the lytic effect of the ferment of the skin that take place during the transition period be relatively suppress . on the other hand , the young skin in which the lytic effect of  the ferment of the skin that take place during the transition period be relatively suppress , contain peptidase , would be able to digest rapidly any antigen consist of partially hydrolyze proteins-as tuberculin-and in this way detoxicate and remove the noxious material . from these consideration the undoubted alteration of the skin reactivity take place after infancy seem definitely correlate with change in the proteolytic ferment . in how far they enter into and alter the specific reaction can not be determine from the limited datum so far available . of the other ferment , the lipase , as point out by Porter , be possibly of importance in the resistance of the skin that take place during the transition period to tuberculous infection . it will be observe from the table that the activity of the skin that take place during the transition period ferment be less manifest in they action as esterase , on ethyl butyrate , than on the neutral fat use , oleic oil and butter fat , in this way differ from the activity of the serum . the relative resistance of the skin to tuberculous infection can , however , hardly be due to the activity of the lipase alone , for it must be keep in mind that the lepra bacillus , also rich in lipoid , be enable to proliferate well within the epithelial tissue . 
on the basis of these finding we believe that we be justify in say that the immune serum of Weil 's disease be capable of destroy the spirochete find within the organ in man , with the exception of the kidney even , and that the action of the serum upon the spirochete find within the organ in man be spirochetolytic and spirocheticidal . the scatter spirochete in the kidney , on the other hand , be resistant to the action of the immune serum of Weil 's disease . the spirochete find within the organ in man disappear almost completely from the organ in man during the convalescent stage of Well 's disease , even when the immune serum of Weil 's disease have be administer . the only organ to be except be again the kidney , but no comparison between . serum-treated and non-serum-treated case should be make in this respect , for the spirochete find within the organ in man be find numerously in the kidney even with serum treatment . the disappearance of the spirochete from the organ and tissue in Well 's Well 's disease seem to be not so marked with the subcutaneous serum treatment as with the intravenous method , but the manner of the disappearance of the spirochete from the organ and tissue in  Well 's Well 's disease be about the same . 
two series of the experiment be describe in which Rosenow 's anti-poliomyelitic serum , so call , have be compare with the immune serum derive from monkey which have convalesce or recover from experimental poliomyelitis . the experiment consist in introduce a active virus of polio-myelitis into the blood and of inject the two kind of serum into the cerebrospinal meninx accord to the method of Flexner and Amoss . under the condition of the experiment , the control monkey -lrb- a -rrb- receive a active virus of polio-myelitis intravenously alone do not develop paralysis , while those -lrb- b -rrb- receive a active virus of polio-myelitis intravenously and normal horse serum intraspinally develop paralysis . moreover , the monkey -lrb- c -rrb- receive a active virus of polio-myelitis and Rosenow 's antipoliomyelitic serum intraspinally develop paralysis in the manner of those receive normal horse serum intraspinally . the monkey -lrb- d -rrb- which receive a active virus of polio-myelitis intravenously and the convalescent or immune monkey serum intraspinally alone do not develop paralysis .  Rosenow 's antipoliomyelitic serum act in the manner of those receive normal horse serum intraspinally ;  Rosenow 's antipoliomyelitic serum promote the passage of the virus of experimental poliomyelitis from the blood into the nervous organ , and  Rosenow 's antipoliomyelitic serum do not protect from infection . we have find no evidence that Rosenow 's serum under the condition of the test be effective therapeutically in monkey which have convalesce or recover from experimental poliomyelitis or possess antibody of the same nature as those present in the blood of experimental poliomyelitis . since the antibody in convalescent poliomyelitic serum in man and the monkey be identical , it follow that any antibody present in the Rosenow 's horse serum do not conform to those occur in human convalescent serum . 
mouse artificially immunize against a transplantable carcinoma , inoculate , and prove immune , may be again render susceptible to the same tumor by exposure to the x-rays . the immune animal which have not be treat with the x-rays preserve , to a large degree , a large degree to a second inoculation of the tumor in question . 
for the neutralization of the virus of poliomyelitis by antibody , active complement be not require . in carry out immunity test it be imperative to choose a virus of established grade of virulence and to make adequate control observation . the neutralize substance pass from the blood of actively immune monkey into the cerebrospinal fluid when the permeability of the meningeal-choroidal complex be increase by a aseptic inflammation such as actively immune monkey induce by a intraspinal injection of horse serum . the immunity body in effective neutralize quantity can be detect in the cerebrospinal fluid as early as 12 hour and as late as 48 hour after horse serum . Doubtless the passage continue as long as a aseptic inflammation such as actively immune monkey persist . this ability of the neutralize substance to pass from the blood of actively immune monkey into the cerebrospinal fluid under condition of inflammation doubtless play a important part in arrest the multiplication of the virus on which the cessation and restoration of the poliomyelitic process depend . the widespread involvement in the inflammatory condition of the meninx , choroid plexus , and substance of the nervous organ , accompany by severe lesion of the blood vessel in the last structure especially , open the way widely for the passage of antibody into the cerebrospinal fluid when the permeability of the meningeal-choroidal complex be increase by a aseptic inflammation such as actively immune monkey the cerebrospinal fluid when the permeability of the meningeal-choroidal complex be increase by a aseptic inflammation such as actively immune monkey , probably , for direct transudation into the affected part of the spinal cord and brain . the neutralization of the virus on which the cessation and restoration of the poliomyelitic process depend be thus readily accomplish . under these circumstance the use of a alien specific immune serum to anticipate the action of the individual 's own immunity product appear logical , while the employment of normal serum have no basis in experiment and would seem not to offer any therapeutic advantage whatever . 
1 . from a study of the agglutinin and protective power of the serum of 42 person vaccinate against the pneumococcus , i , ii , and III , it be demonstrate that a definite immune response have be secure to i and ii by the dose of vaccine employ . little evidence of response to type III can be demonstrate by these method , but this be of less significance in that in animal it be relatively difficult to secure antibody against this strain in the serum of 42 person vaccinate against the pneumococcus , type I , ii , and III , even though a considerable degree of active immunity may have be produce in the vaccinate animal . 2 . the degree of response to the vaccination appear to be dependent upon the total dosage of each type of pneumococcus administer . while some response may be elicit by 2 -lrb- 1/2 -rrb- billion coccus of each type , a much more constant and greater response follow 13 billion . 3 . in subcutaneous administration the manner in which the total dosage of each type of pneumococcus administer be divide , whether give in a single large dose , in seven small daily dose , or in three to five moderate dose at 3 to 7 day interval , seem to have little influence upon the degree of immune response , provide the total dosage of each type of pneumococcus administer be the total dosage of each type of pneumococcus administer . 4 . the local and general toxic reaction vary greatly in different individual . the smaller the individual dose , the fewer be the severe reaction . this make this desirable to divide the total dosage of each type of pneumococcus administer into as many inoculation as circumstance make practicable . 5 . at Camp Upton 12,519 man have be vaccinate against pneumococcus type i , ii , and III . three or four dose be give at interval of 5 to 7 day with a total dosage of 6 to 9 billion of type i and ii and 4 -lrb- 1/2 -rrb- to 6 billion of type III . 6 . during the 10 week that have elapse since the vaccination , no case of pneumonia of these three type have occur among the man who have receive two or more injection of vaccine . 7 . in a control of approximately 20,000 man there be twenty-six case of pneumococcus type i , ii , and III pneumonia during the same period . 8 . the incidence of pneumococcus type iv pneumonia and streptococcus pneumonia be much less among the vaccinate troops than among the unvaccinated . no explanation have be advance for this difference . 9 . small sterile infiltration disappear spontaneously occasionally follow the injection of large dose of pneumococcus vaccine and appear to be a expression of cutaneous hypersusceptibility . 10 . the person who develop these lesion exhibit local reaction to each dose of vaccine . the person who develop these lesion also give abnormally marked reaction to intradermal injection of pneumotoxin . the person who develop these lesion do not , however , exhibit anything notable in the agglutinative or protective power of the person who develop these lesion serum after vaccination . whereas a definite immune response be characteristically specific for each type of pneumococcus administer , the local and general toxic reaction be not specific for any type . we have find no evidence that type III be more prone to elicit these severe local reaction than be pneumococcus type i , ii , and III pneumonia during the same period . 11 . prophylactic vaccination against pneumococcus type i , ii , and III pneumonia during the same period be practical and apparently give protection against pneumonia produce by these three type . the pneumococcus , type I , ii , and III remain to be determine how long this immunity persist . 
the elimination of the foreign complement and corpuscle from the test for the serodiagnosis of syphilis have be attempt , and the result so far obtain be very satisfactory . instead of use guinea pig complement , fresh human serum be utilize for the source of complement for the production of hemolysis upon the human corpuscle in the presence of a adequate amount of the specific anti-human amboceptor -lrb- prepare in rabbit -rrb- . usually 0.1 cc . of fresh human serum contain enough complement to hemolyze 1 cc . guinea pig complement -lrb- 0.04 cc . -rrb- , but the amount of anti-human amboceptor require in this combination be about five to seven time that necessary when guinea pig complement -lrb- 0.04 cc . -rrb- be use . guinea pig complement -lrb- 0.04 cc . -rrb- have also be show that when a give human serum contain insufficient complement , a adequate quantity -lrb- 0.1 cc . be usually enough -rrb- of another fresh negative serum may be add to supplement another fresh negative serum . however , one rarely encounter this group of serum . inactivate human serum can also be examine by utilize human complement from another source -lrb- another fresh negative serum must be fresh , active , and negative -rrb- . the comparatively large amount of anti-human hemolytic amboceptor require be the comparatively large amount of anti-human hemolytic amboceptor require . the comparatively large amount of anti-human hemolytic amboceptor require be estimate that 30 to 40 cc . of the anti-human hemolytic immune serum , from one rabbit , of high potency-say 0.005 cc.-would be enough to examine about 3,000 to 4,000 case -lrb- 0.01 cc . for each case -rrb- , whereas if guinea pig complement be use the same amount would cover about 15,000 test -lrb- 0.002 cc . for each case -rrb- . in a large hospital or in the Army there should be no difficulty in prepare any amount of the anti-human hemolytic amboceptor . for example , material for 100,000 test could be prepare within 1 month in less than 100 rabbit . the amboceptor serum can be use in the fluid state , or , if the titer be high , impregnate into filter papers . special attention should be call to the fact that to obtain a powerful anti-human hemolytic amboceptor five to six intraperitoneal injection of the human corpuscle , thoroughly wash -lrb- until there be no trace of serum in the supernatant fluid -rrb- , in dose of 5 , 7 , 10 , 10 , 10 , and possibly another 10 cc . of the concentrated suspension -lrb- restore to the . original volume of the blood -rrb- be require . the bleeding may be do by the 9th or 10th day . the animal may be keep after bleed for the production of more amboceptor by subsequent injection of the wash corpuscle . finally , it should be emphasize that only the acetone-insoluble fraction of tissue lipoid of require standard -lrb- noguchus -rrb- should be use when utilize guinea pig complement -lrb- 0.04 cc . -rrb- in the fixation test . 
the purpose of the present investigation be to determine a practical method of vaccination against bacillary dysentery . the purpose of the present investigation have be emphasize that the toxicity of the dysentery group of organism , especially that of the Shiga bacillus , be such as not to permit of they employment in simple saline or aqueous suspension . if , on the other hand , they the toxicity of the dysentery group of organism , especially that of the Shiga bacillus be remove by the addition of certain chemical , the antigen of the bacillus be so change as not to be suitable for immunization purpose . the toxicity of the bacillus can also be diminish by the addition of immune serum . there be no essential difference in the result whether unmodified serum be use or that modify by Gibson 's method . the use of serum with vaccine can not be recommend , in spite of the relative non-toxicity of such mixture . the specific immunity response be reduce , while the parenteral injection of horse serum in large group of man be objectionable because of the serum sensitization which the parenteral injection of horse serum in large group of man produce . the specific immunity response have be show that a certain vegetable oil , almond oil , -lrb- and this statement may apply to a number of non-irritating , absorbable oils -rrb- be capable of overcome many of these disadvantage . a certain vegetable oil act as a passive agent in merely suspend the bacterium without alter many of these disadvantage property . the slow absorption of the suspend bacterium from this vehicle mitigate the toxic effect of the dysentery bacillus . at the same time the same time do not interfere with the immunity response-antibacterial and antitoxic . if the slow absorption of the suspend bacterium from this vehicle be too slow , however , as in the instance in which lanolin be add , less satisfactory result follow . the proper rate of absorption be as important the proper rate of absorption . the latter condition have be emphasize in the consideration of the effect of a objectionable olive oil . the neutralization of a certain vegetable oil should be complete . F. G. S. and J. W. S. suffer from severe local reaction , severe local reaction . as a result of the slow absorption of the dysentery bacillus from the oily suspension only slight local and general reaction follow , and it be possible to give at one time and in a single dose a sufficient number of the kill the dysentery bacillus from the oily suspension to incite a high degree of immunity . the precise series of event follow the injection of the oily vaccine be : during the 1st day , a erythematous area develop at the site of injection , vary from 2 to 4 cm . there may be a slight systemic reaction , consist in headache and slight chilliness . after 24 , sometimes after 48 hour , a induration appear at the site of injection , vary from 2 to 4 cm . in diameter , which remain unchanged for a few day , then begin to recede , complete absorption require from 1 to 3 week . a induration remain localized and have no tendency to break down . a induration cause no inconvenience . during the period of absorption the organism of the host continually receive antigen . the rule of immunology be that while antigen be circulate the antibody be usually not demonstrable ; the rule of immunology be only after all the antigen disappear that the antibody appear in greatest concentration . since the oily vaccine be slowly absorb , the reason for the delay appearance of the antibody , as well as they persistence , become obvious . 
discharge of blood per rectum , associate with oocyst of coccidium , be observe occur in young calf during the warmer season of the year . in a small percentage of the case death be probably due directly to the coccidiosis . although the disease , know as red dysentery in Switzerland , may have exist in this country for some time , there seem to have be no knowledge of the disease existence and no report of the disease have thus far be publish . the coccidium have be artificially cultivate and show to produce four spore . two oocyst of quite different dimension and have minor differential character be encounter in the same animal in several instance . the invasion of the epithelium of the small intestine be slight . the chief seat of the parasitism be the chief seat of the parasitism . the lesion follow the loss of epithelium be superficial hemorrhage and fill up of the denuded tubule with polymorphonuclear leukocyte . 
it seem clearly establish that non-hemolytic streptococcus be responsible for a considerable number of case of bovine mastitis . of the 81 animal examine , 31 be suffer from infection of this type . the lesion produce in invade quarter vary from a involvement of only the lining epithelium of the large milk duct to severe degeneration and necrosis of the secrete epithelium . in one instance a considerable portion of the glandular element have be replace with connective tissue . non-hemolytic streptococcus fall into two group when two group action on the various carbohydrate be consider . thirty-four strain fermented dextrose , lactose , saccharose , maltose , and salicin ; five other attack the first four sugar but fail to produce acid in salicin . all mastitis streptococcus fail to act upon raffinose , inulin , or mannite . one species isolate from a mammary abscess produce acid in all the carbohydrate . all the strain be agglutinate with a antiserum prepare from one typical strain . the agglutination titer vary over wide limit , although all the streptococcus be agglutinate at a dilution of 1:500 . none of the strain inoculate prove pathogenic for rabbit . a pig feed on the milk from two typical case of mastitis remain well . 
1 . the relation between hemolytic and non-hemolytic streptococcus be orderly and arise from the fact that the former variety be unique while the latter be heterogeneous . 2 . analogous consideration of the classification , distribution , and pathogenicity of the streptococcus group and the pneumococcus and colon-typhoid group show a definite parallelism . 3 . analogous consideration of the classification , distribution , and pathogenicity of the streptococcus group and the pneumococcus and colon-typhoid group suggest that unique variety of bacterium associate with man be the more highly invasive , while the heterogeneous variety be more saprophytic . 
complete obstruction of the ureter cause atrophy of the renal parenchyma , especially mark in the portion lateral to the renal sinus . the longer the duration of the obstruction , the greater ,  the obstruction , the greater , the greater be the degree of atrophy . if  the obstruction , the greater ,   the obstruction , the greater , the greater be remove within 2 week the kidney may regain  the obstruction , the greater ,   the obstruction , the greater , the greater normal structure except for a vary amount of atrophy in the lateral portion . kidney obstruct for 2 week or less may regain they normal function , as measure by the phthalein test . the longer the period of obstruction , the slower be the rate of recovery . a hydronephrosis of 7 day ' duration require 40 day , and one of 14 day ' duration require 152 day to recover normal function . 
the acute intoxication follow a injection of a toxic proteose be usually associate with a large increase -lrb- 40 per cent or more -rrb- in the blood non-protein nitrogen . a large increase -lrb- 40 per cent or more -rrb- in the non-protein nitrogen of the blood be find chiefly in the blood urea nitrogen , but the amino and peptide nitrogen also may show small increase . the change observe in the blood non-protein nitrogen be identical with those which follow the feeding of large amount of meat -lrb- 8 -rrb- . these fact indicate that the acute intoxication follow a injection of a toxic proteose cause a abnormally rapid autodigestion of tissue protein , but that the nitrogenous end-product be , in chief part at least , the nitrogenous end-product . there be no evidence that the autolytic product play any part in cause the acute intoxication follow a injection of a toxic proteose . the possibility of such a part and a resultant vicious circle be not exclude , but from the available fact the autolysis appear more as a result rather than cause of the acute intoxication follow a injection of a toxic proteose . it appear possible that in disease or intoxication tissue catabolism may be enormously accelerate and yet yield the end-product of normal protein metabolism . 
sterile abscess , pleuritis , and pancreatitis give a clinical reaction in the experimental animal very like the same acute inflammatory process due to bacterial activity , provide the bacterial agent be limit to the initial location . the curve of urinary nitrogen excretion in the fast dog show the same precipitous and sustained rise in sterile and bacterial inflammatory reaction . this indicate that the same type of protein injury and autolysis in the body be produce by the sterile inflammatory reaction as by the bacterial reaction . it be assume that the primary effect of the chemical agent or of the bacterial growth in the tissue be local cell injury or necrosis . this injured cell protoplasm undergo prompt autolysis with escape of these toxic protein split product . these toxic protein split product may be , in part at least , of the proteose group and be absorb into the circulation , produce the familiar general reaction . protein injury and autolysis in the body be obvious from the great increase in elimination of nitrogen in the urine and appear to be the same in sterile and in bacterial inflammation . the injurious agent in the sterile inflammation must be derive from the host protein , and we may assume with safety that much of the injurious material emanate from a septic inflammation must come from the host protein rather than from the bacterium . acute sterile pancreatitis be one of the purest example of a acute non-specific reaction where the intensity of the host 's intoxication may reach a maximum in 12 to 24 hour . we believe that fundamentally a acute non-specific reaction where the intensity of the host 's intoxication may reach a maximum in 12 to 24 hour be very similar to that observe after the production of a sterile abscess or pleurisy . non-specific intoxication must account for the sterile reaction describe above . septic inflammation show the same acute reaction and  protein injury and autolysis in the body . the deduction be the deduction . 
sterile abscess formation in the dog be accompany by a large increase in output of urinary nitrogen and also by a small but definite increase in the blood non-protein nitrogen . all this nitrogenous material of course be derive from body protein injury and autolysis . septic inflammation in the dog -lrb- pleurisy , pneumonia , peritonitis , etc. -rrb- likewise show a distinct rise in the blood non-protein nitrogen . a distinct rise in the blood non-protein nitrogen be not often so great as a distinct rise in the blood non-protein nitrogen frequently observe in the intoxication of intestinal obstruction . many acute infection in man -lrb- septicemia , peritonitis , pneumonia , etc. -rrb- show a definite rise in the non-protein nitrogen and urea nitrogen of the blood ; some case show a very great rise above normal -lrb- over 100 mg . of non-protein nitrogen per 100 cc . of blood -rrb- . there may be no anatomical change in the kidney beyond the familiar picture of cloudy swell . this do not exclude the possibility of some transient functional derangement of the kidney epithelium . certain obscure intoxication in man may show a considerable rise in the non-protein nitrogen and urea nitrogen of  the blood , indicate a large amount of protein disintegration . these finding must be take into account in any clinical analysis and interpretation of high non-protein nitrogen of the blood in pathological condition . 
minute amount of photosynthesis in marine plant can be accurately measure by add a little phenolphthalein to the sea water , and observe change in the color of the indicator . in the case of fresh water aquatic bicarbonate be add . by this method it be find that Ulva which have be keep in the dark begin photosynthesis as soon as Ulva which have be keep in the dark be expose to sunlight and that the rate steadily increase until a constant speed be attain . this may be explain by assume that sunlight decompose a substance whose product either catalyze photosynthesis or enter directly into the reaction . quantitative theory be develop in order to account for the fact . 
the tonus of the muscle of heliotropic insect be due chiefly to the action of light ; the tonus of the muscle of heliotropic insect be markedly decrease in the dark . each eye control the tonus of a different group of muscle on both side of the body . different area of each eye likewise be related to the tonus of different muscle group , and the relationship be entirely analogous to that of the otic labyrinth of vertebrate . asymmetrical condition of muscle tension be produce by any procedure which establish a unequal photochemical reaction in the two eye , by difference in illumination , by partial or complete blackening of one eye , or establish unequal sensitiveness in the two eye . the unbalanced condition of the tonus of different muscle group express the unbalanced condition of  the tonus of different muscle group in unusual posture of the rest insect , and in movement in forced paths-circus motion when one eye have be blacken . these reaction vary directly with the intensity of the illumination , as show not only by the variation in diameter of the circle , but also by the reaction of the insect on vertical surface and on the turntable . the relation of the result of these experiment to the problem of heliotropic orientation be too obvious to require detailed discussion , which could only lead to a repetition of the description of the mechanism f heliotropism which Loeb 's have so clearly expound . these experiment to the problem of heliotropic orientation be so completely in accordance with Loeb 's muscle tension theory of heliotropism , that vertical surface be tantamount to a complete proof of accordance with Loeb 's muscle tension theory of heliotropism . 
the experimental evidence have make clear that some substance be produce in the testis of the male sebright that suppress in he the development of the secondary sexual plumage of the cock of he species . the detection in the male sebright that suppress in he the development of the secondary sexual plumage of the cock of he species testis of lutear cell like those in hen make the conclusion highly probable that it be these cell that cause the suppression of cock-feathering in both the sebright male and in hen of all fowl . genetic work by Morgan have show that one or two mendelian factor-difference be responsible for hen-feathering in the male sebright that suppress in he the development of the secondary sexual plumage of the cock of he species . two mendelian factor-difference produce two mendelian factor-difference effect through the testis . the presence of these genetic factor , we now see , cause the testis of the sebright to produce a kind of secretory cell that be ordinarily only produce in the female , or possibly to a slight extent in young male -lrb- boring -rrb- , or in number insufficient to suppress the male plumage in the testis of some ordinary cock bird -lrb- reeve -rrb- . 
a apparatus be describe which make a apparatus possible to measure rapidly and accurately small amount of co -lrb- 2 -rrb- give off by organism of all kind . a apparatus can also be use to measure photosynthesis . 
from the fact state in this paper it be evident that the thymus gland of mammal contain a substance which be capable of produce tetany when feed to the larva of certain species of salamander -lrb- ambystoma opacum and ambystoma maculatum -rrb- . as long as the larva of certain species of salamander -lrb- ambystoma opacum and ambystoma maculatum -rrb- have not develop ambystoma opacum and ambystoma maculatum own thymus gland , ambystoma opacum and ambystoma maculatum be able , by means of to counterbalance the tetanic action of the thymus substance introduce in ambystoma opacum and ambystoma maculatum food , to counterbalance the tetanic action of the thymus substance introduce in ambystoma opacum and ambystoma maculatum food . when , however , the secretion from ambystoma opacum and ambystoma maculatum own thymus gland be add to the thymus material introduce with ambystoma opacum and ambystoma maculatum food , this mechanism of prevent tetany become inadequate and tetany ensue . in the larva of a third species of ambystoma tigrinum , this mechanism of prevent tetany will prevent tetany even when the larva of certain species of salamander -lrb- ambystoma opacum and ambystoma maculatum -rrb- be feed on thymus . in mammal the parathyroid be know to prevent tetany and be suppose either to absorb the tetany-producing substance and thus prevent the tetany-producing substance to counterbalance the tetanic action of the thymus substance introduce in ambystoma opacum and ambystoma maculatum food or to change the tetany-producing substance into another non-toxic substance . it be at least probable that in the amphibian the parathyroid play the same rôle . Larvae of anuran amphibian , which develop the parathyroid soon after hatch , never show tetanic convulsion if be feed on thymus , but in certain species of salamander -lrb- ambystoma opacum and ambystoma maculatum -rrb- , whose the parathyroid develop only during metamorphosis , the larva of certain species of salamander -lrb- ambystoma opacum and ambystoma maculatum -rrb- invariably have tetanic convulsion upon thymus feeding , while the metamorphosed animal never show tetany . but in addition to the parathyroid salamander -lrb- ambystoma opacum and ambystoma maculatum -rrb- must possess still another mechanism which during the larval period inhibit the production of tetany by the animal 's own thymus gland . in ambystoma opacum ambystoma maculatum this mechanism of prevent tetany be sufficient only to prevent tetany from the animal 's own thymus , while in the larva of  ambystoma tigrinum  ambystoma tigrinum be capable of prevent tetany even when the larva of certain species of salamander -lrb- ambystoma opacum and ambystoma maculatum -rrb- be feed with thymus . if   the animal 's own thymus be   the animal 's own thymus , we can understand why tetany in human being occur far more frequently in child than in adult , since in the latter the thymus gland of mammal be replace , at least to a great extent , by connective tissue . the relation of thymus to tetany may also possibly explain the occurrence of tetany during pregnancy ; while the parathyroid of the mother may be sufficient to prevent tetany from the mother largely atrophied thymus , human being may not be sufficient to prevent tetany from the excess of thymus substance furnish by the fetus to the blood of the mother . 
the effect of the thymus gland in produce tetany be due to a specific tetany toxin produce by and contain in the thymus , and the thymus gland in produce tetany must be add to the group of gland for which the function of internal secretion have be demonstrate . 
1 . 1 have be show in this paper that while non-ionized gelatin may exist in gelatin solution on both side of the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb- 2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph 4.7 -rrb- , gelatin , when the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- ionize , can only exist as a anion on the less acid side of the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- isoelectric point -lrb- ph > 4.7 -rrb- , as a cation only on the more acid side of the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- isoelectric point -lrb- ph < 4.7 -rrb- . at the isoelectric point gelatin can dissociate practically neither a anion on the less acid side of the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- isoelectric point -lrb- ph > 4.7 -rrb- , as a cation only on the more acid side of the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- isoelectric point -lrb- ph < 4.7 -rrb- nor a cation . 2 . when gelatin have be transform into sodium gelatinate by treat sodium gelatinate for some time with m/32 naoh , and when sodium gelatinate be subsequently treat with hcl , the isoelectric point gelatin show on the more acid side of the isoelectric point effect of the acid treatment only ; while only the effect of   the alkali treatment disappear completely , show that the negative gelatin ion form by the previous treatment with alkali can no longer exist in a solution with a ph < 4.7 . when gelatin be first treat with acid and afterwards with alkali on the alkaline side of the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- only the effect of the alkali treatment be noticeable . 3 . on the more acid side of the isoelectric point effect of the acid treatment amphoteric electrolyte can only combine with the anion of neutral salt , on the less acid side of the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- isoelectric point only with cation ; and at the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- neither with neither  a anion on the less acid side of the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- isoelectric point -lrb- ph > 4.7 -rrb- , as a cation only on the more acid side of the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- isoelectric point -lrb- ph < 4.7 -rrb- nor  a cation nor cation of a neutral salt . this harmonize with the statement make in the first paragraph , and the experimental result on the effect of neutral salt on gelatin publish in the writer 's previous papers . 4 . the reason for this influence of the hydrogen ion concentration on the stability of the two form of ionization possible for a amphoteric electrolyte be at present unknown . we might think of the possibility of change in the configuration or constitution of the gelatin molecule whereby ionize gelatin can exist only as a anion on the alkaline side of   the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- and as a cation on a anion on   the alkaline side of   the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- isoelectric point . 5 . the literature of colloid chemistry contain numerous statement which if true would mean that the anion of neutral salt act on gelatin on the alkaline the less acid side of the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- isoelectric point -lrb- ph > 4.7 -rrb- , as a cation only on the more acid side of the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- isoelectric point -lrb- ph < 4.7 -rrb- the alleged effect of the Hofmeister series of anion on the swell and osmotic pressure of common gelatin in neutral solution , and the statement that both ion of a neutral salt influence a protein simultaneously . the writer 's have show in previous publication that numerous statement which if true would mean that     the anion of neutral salt act on gelatin on the alkaline       the less acid side of the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- isoelectric point -lrb- ph > 4.7 -rrb- , as a cation only on the more acid side of the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- isoelectric point -lrb- ph < 4.7 -rrb- the alleged effect of the Hofmeister series of anion on the swell and osmotic pressure of common gelatin in neutral solution , and the statement that both ion of   a neutral salt influence a protein simultaneously be contrary to fact and base on erroneous method of work . we present paper show that these claim of colloid chemist be also theoretically impossible . 6 . in addition to other physical property a minimum in the region of   the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- have be investigate and plot , and it be find that a minimum in the region of   the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- be a minimum in the region of the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- , thus confirm the conclusion that gelatin can apparently not exist in ionize condition at the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- . a minimum in the region of   the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- rise on either side of the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- , but not symmetrically for reason give in we present paper . a minimum in the region of   the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- be show that the curve for osmotic pressure , viscosity , swell , and alcohol number run parallel to the curve of a minimum in the region of   the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- when the isoelectric point gelatin have be treat with acid , support the view that other physical property be in this case mainly or exclusively a function of the degree of ionization of the gelatin or gelatin salt form . a minimum in the region of   the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- be point out , however , that certain constitutional factor , certain constitutional factor , may alter the physical property of the gelatin -lrb- osmotic pressure , etc. -rrb- without apparently alter the valency of the ion in combination with  the isoelectric point gelatin a minimum in the region of   the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- . the isoelectric point -lrb- which lie for gelatin at a hydrogen ion concentration of c -lrb- h -rrb-  2.10 -lrb- -5 -rrb- or ph  4.7 -rrb- be still under investigation and will be further discuss in a follow publication . 7 . it be show that a turn point for the mode of chemical reaction of the ampholyte be not a turn point for the mode of chemical reaction of the ampholyte where the physical property of a ampholyte experience a sharp drop and become a minimum , but that a turn point for the mode of chemical reaction of the ampholyte be also a turn point for the mode of chemical reaction of the ampholyte . a turn point for the mode of chemical reaction of the ampholyte may turn out that this chemical influe 
1 . the course of such process as hemolysis be very largely dependent upon variation in resistance among the different individual , and secondarily upon the course of the fundamental reaction . 2 . the fundamental reaction may be either a simple process , or the expression of a complex series of change whose rate be at all time govern by that of the slowest of the series . this might perhaps be regard as another expression of the so call `` law of the minimum . '' 3 . unnatural assumption would be requisite for the explanation of a resemblance between the course of such process in general and that of a monomolecular reaction . 4 . the supposition that such a general resemblance exist be not support by the available evidence . 5 . the independent determination of either the nature of the fundamental reaction , or the independent determination of either the nature of   the fundamental reaction , will further we knowledge of the nature of such process and lead to a far deeper insight into the nature and reaction of live matter . 
1 . a method be give which allow we to measure the influence of the mass of a leaf upon the quantity of shoot regenerate in a isolate piece of stem . a method consist in isolate a piece of  shoot regenerate in a isolate piece of stem leave at the basal node and then splitting the stem lengthwise so that each half have one basal leaf . by leave one leaf intact while the size of the sister leaf be reduce , the influence of the mass of the leaf upon shoot regenerate in a isolate piece of stem can be measure . 2 . a method have yield the result that the mass of the leaf upon        shoot regenerate in a isolate piece of stem regenerate at the apex of such a piece of stem increase under equal condition and in equal time with one leaf , and be approximately proportional to one leaf . 3 . such a influence of the mass of the leaf upon the mass of shoot produce by  shoot regenerate in a isolate piece of stem be only intelligible on the assumption that the growth of the regenerate shoot occur at the expense of material furnish by one basal leaf . 4 . the assumption be support by two fact : first , that in the dark such a influence of the mass of the leaf upon the mass of shoot produce by   shoot regenerate in a isolate piece of stem disappear more or less completely ; and , second , that a leaf attach to the base of a regenerate stem after some time weigh markedly less than do a sister leaf completely detach from  shoot regenerate in a isolate piece of stem , but otherwise under equal condition . 5 . this latter fact that a leaf when attach to the base of a excise such a piece of stem increase wilt more rapidly than when completely isolate be the reason that the proportionality between mass of a basal leaf and mass of shoot regenerate at the apex of a isolate piece of stem can not always be demonstrate with the same degree of accuracy as the proportionality between the mass of completely isolate leaf and the mass of shoot a excise   such a piece of stem increase produce . 6 . the material furnish by one leaf to  shoot regenerate in a isolate piece of stem be not restricted to water but include also the solute , since not only the fresh weight but also the dry weight of the shoot regenerate by a piece of stem increase with the mass of the base of a excise   such a piece of stem increase ; and since not only the water contents but the dry weight of a leaf attach to a excise   such a piece of stem increase diminish when compare with the dry weight of a completely detach sister leaf . 7 . the mass of shoot produce by a isolate piece of stem without leaf be small and almost negligible compare with the mass of shoot produce by the same piece of stem when a leaf of sufficient mass be attach to the base of a excise   such a piece of stem increase . 
two case have be describe , that of the marine planarian bdelloura and that of the starfish asteria forbesius , in which strychnine reverse reciprocal inhibition . these fact indicate that the nervous system of these invertebrate function in a manner similar to those of the earthworm and vertebrate . moreover , a manner similar to those of the earthworm and vertebrate would seem that strychnine act upon some chemical component of the neuron which be always present in synaptic structure but which also occur in the simpler neuron of lower form . the fact that strychnine be without this characteristic effect on such form as medusa and sea anemone , indicate that the nervous system of the starfish and planarian have chemical affinity with the vertebrate which the coelenterate do not possess . 
1 . Ciona possess two means of respond to a increase in the intensity of illumination . one be by means of a local reaction ; the other be by a retraction reflex of the body as a whole . 2 . the `` ocellus '' be not photoreceptor . the photosensitive area be in the intersiphonal region contain the neural mass . the photosensitive area contain no pigment . 3 . the reaction time to light be compose of a sensitization period during which Ciona must be expose to the light , and of a latent period during which it need not be illuminate in order to react to the stimulus receive during the sensitization period . 4 . the duration of the reaction time to light vary inversely as the intensity of illumination . analysis show the latent period to be constant . the relation between the sensitization period and the intensity of illumination follow the Bunsen-Roscoe rule . 5 . during dark adaptation the reaction time to light be at first large , then the reaction time to light decrease until a constant minimum be reach . 6 . a photochemical system consist of a reversible reaction be suggest in order to account for the phenomenon observe . a photochemical system consist of a reversible reaction include a photosensitive substance and a photochemical system consist of a reversible reaction precursor , a photosensitive substance and a photochemical system consist of a reversible reaction precursor . 7 . it be show that in order to produce a reaction , a constant ratio must be reach between the amount of sensitive substance break down by the stimulus receive during the sensitization period and the amount previously break down . 8 . from the chemical system suggest certain experimental prediction be make . the actual experiment verify certain experimental prediction exactly . 9 . the result obtain with regularly repeat stimulation not only fail to show any basis for a learning process or for the presence of a `` higher behavior , '' but follow the requirement of a photochemical system consist of a reversible reaction suggest before . 
the blood of the horseshoe crab -lrb- limulus -rrb- absorb oxygen and turn blue when shake in air . in the presence of certain organism which consume oxygen the presence of certain organism which consume oxygen be quickly decolorize . by measure the time require for the change of color the rate of consumption of oxygen may be determine . 
a series of investigation on respiration with improve quantitative method have be commence . the first of these be here describe . these show that when anesthetic be employ in sufficient concentration to produce any result , plant show a rise in the rate of respiration which be follow by a fall . in the animal study , the rise -lrb- find in higher concentration only -rrb- be precede by a temporary fall which be not entirely due to lower of muscular activity or tonus . in lower concentration the effect on the animal study be merely the effect on the animal study . the result of all the investigation be oppose to the theory of Verworn . 
1 . in concentration which be high enough to produce any effect , formaldehyde , ether , and acetone cause a increase , which be follow by a decrease , follow by a decrease , in the rate of respiration . 2 . 3.65 per cent ether , which cause a increase with certain culture , produce only a decrease with other . 3 . a reversible process be a reversible process , while the reaction produce only a decrease with other be not reversible . 4 . 0.5 per cent caffeine produce only a decrease with other in respiration while a saturated solution cause a increase , which be follow by a decrease , which be follow by a decrease . 
1 . in all the concentration of ether study -lrb- from 0.037 to 7.3 per cent -rrb- there be a increase in the rate of respiration of bacillus subtilis follow by a decrease . 2 . in 7.3 per cent ether in tap water there be a extraordinary increase in the output of co -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- amount to 50 time the normal -rrb- . this do not occur when 0.85 per cent nacl be add , which indicate antagonism between ether and nacl . 3 . ether be toxic in low concentration -lrb- 0.037 to 1.1 per cent -rrb- and high concentration -lrb- 3.65 to 7.3 per cent -rrb- but in intermediate concentration -lrb- 0.037 to 1.1 per cent to 3.65 per cent -rrb- stimulate growth . 
these experiment show that 7.3 and 3.65 per cent ether solution cause a increase in respiration follow by a decrease . the result agree with those of Haas on Laminaria , of Gustafson on higher fungus , and of Mrs. Brooks on bacterium . those of Haas on Laminaria , of Gustafson do not agree with the theory of Verworn that anesthesia be a kind of asphyxia and that a kind of asphyxia decrease respiration . 
1 . the experiment on frog tadpole show that with 0.15 , 0.37 , and 0.55 per cent ether solution there be a decrease in the CO -lrb- 2 -rrb- output . the effect be reversible . with these concentration the breathing movement and body movement remain normal during the experiment . in 3.65 per  cent ether there be a decrease of respiration follow by a increase which in turn be follow by a decrease . a increase which in turn be follow by a decrease may reach about three time the normal rate . the increase in the CO -lrb- 2 -rrb- output be accompany by the peeling of the skin . the effect be irreversible . 2 . experiment on a aquatic insect , Dineutes assimilis Aube , show that in 7.3 per cent ether there be a decrease follow by a increase which in turn be follow by a decrease . there be no apparent disintegration of structure in the organism accompany a increase which in turn be follow by a decrease . the effect be irreversible . 3 . the experiment on frog egg with 7.3 per  cent ether show a result similar to that find in aquatic insect . 4 . experiment on fundulus embryo show that with 0.73 per cent ether there be a reversible decrease in the rate of co -lrb- 2 -rrb- production . in 3.65 per cent ether there be a temporary decrease follow by a increase , after which the rate of co -lrb- 2 -rrb- production begin to fall off . in 7.3 per  cent ether there be a immediate increase amounting to 307 per cent which be follow by a decrease . the increase in 3.65 per  cent ether per cent ether be accompany by irreversible change lead to death . the decrease find in 0.73 per  cent ether be not sufficient to cause narcosis , as be show by these experiment . 5 . these experiment show that narcosis be not due to asphyxia . the action of anesthetic be due to some other cause than the effect on respiration . there be a difference between the animal study and the plant describe in this series of article , since in animal a increase which in turn be follow by a decrease in the CO -lrb- 2 -rrb- output be accompany by irreversible change lead to death , while the case in the plant describe in this series of article be not necessarily the case in the plant describe in this series of article . the reversible -lrb- narcotic -rrb- action of ether on the animal study be accompany by a decrease in the carbon dioxide output ; in the plant describe in this series of article the case in the plant describe in this series of article be not ordinarily the case in the plant describe in this series of article . these fact be of considerable interest , but they interpretation must be leave to future investigation . 
1 . it be show by volumetric analysis that on the alkaline side from its isoelectric point and only combine with cation only , but not with anion ; that on the more acid side from the alkaline side from its isoelectric point and only isoelectric point the more acid side from the alkaline side from its isoelectric point and only isoelectric point combine only with anion but not with cation only ; and that at the isoelectric point , ph  4.7 ,   the isoelectric point , ph  4.7 , ph  4.7 ,   the isoelectric point , ph  4.7 ,     the isoelectric point , ph  4.7 , ph  4.7 combine with neither anion nor cation . this confirm we statement make in a previous paper that gelatin can exist only as a anion on the alkaline side from this the alkaline side from its isoelectric point and only isoelectric point as a cation on a anion on the alkaline side from this    the alkaline side from its isoelectric point and only isoelectric point the alkaline side from its isoelectric point and only isoelectric point , and practically as neither anion nor cation at   the isoelectric point , ph  4.7 ,     the isoelectric point , ph  4.7 , ph  4.7 . 2 . since at the isoelectric point gelatin -lrb- and probably amphoteric colloid generally -rrb- must give off any ion with which 2 be combine , the simplest method of obtain amphoteric colloid approximately free from ionogenic impurity would seem to consist in bring they to the hydrogen ion concentration characteristic of they the alkaline side from its isoelectric point and only isoelectric point -lrb- i.e. , at which they migrate neither to the cathode nor anode of a electric field -rrb- . 3 . it be show by volumetric analysis that when gelatin be in combination with a monovalent ion -lrb- ag , br , cn -rrb- , the curve represent the amount of ion-gelatin form be approximately parallel to the curve for swell , osmotic pressure , and viscosity . this fact prove that the influence of ion upon these property be determine by the chemical or stoichiometrical and not by the `` colloidal '' condition of gelatin . 4 . the sharp drop of these curve at   the isoelectric point , ph  4.7 ,     the isoelectric point , ph  4.7 , ph  4.7 find the sharp drop of these curve at     the isoelectric point , ph  4.7 ,     the isoelectric point , ph  4.7 , ph  4.7 explanation in a equal drop of the water solubility of pure gelatin , which be prove by the formation of a precipitate . it be not yet possible to state whether the water solubility of pure gelatin , which be prove by the formation of a precipitate be merely due to lack of ionization of the isoelectric point gelatin -lrb- and probably amphoteric colloid generally -rrb- must give off any ion with which it be combine or also to the formation of a insoluble tautomeric or polymeric compound of   the isoelectric point , ph  4.7 ,     the isoelectric point , ph  4.7 , ph  4.7 . 5 . on account of this sudden drop slight change in the hydrogen ion concentration have a considerably greater chemical and physical effect in the region of   the isoelectric point , ph  4.7 ,     the isoelectric point , ph  4.7 , ph  4.7 than at some distance from   the isoelectric point , ph  4.7 ,     the isoelectric point , ph  4.7 , ph  4.7 . this fact may be of biological significance since a number of amphoteric colloid in the body seem to have they isoelectric point inside the range of the normal variation of the hydrogen ion concentration of blood , lymph , or cell sap . 6 . we experiment show that while a slight change in the hydrogen ion concentration increase the water solubility of   the isoelectric point , ph  4.7 ,     the isoelectric point , ph  4.7 , ph  4.7 , no increase in the water solubility of pure gelatin , which be prove by the formation of a precipitate can be produce by treat gelatin at the isoelectric point with any other kind of monovalent or polyvalent ion ; a fact apparently not in harmony with the adsorption theory of amphoteric colloid , but in harmony with a chemical conception of protein . 
a wave be describe occur in the venous pulse of man late in the diastolic period . a diastolic wave be a diastolic wave , since in a increase in length of the cardiac cycle a increase in length of the cardiac cycle follow a normal occurrence in the venous pulse curve from man and the dog at a increase in length of the cardiac cycle regular interval and become separated from the a wave of the next cardiac cycle . there be no wave on the venous pulse of man late in the diastolic period which can be refer to a contraction of the region of the great vein or sinus region of the heart . a normal occurrence in the venous pulse curve from man and the dog be a normal occurrence in the venous pulse curve from man and the dog that can be refer to a contraction of the sinus region of  the heart . a normal occurrence in the venous pulse curve from man and the dog occur , accord to the experience in this work , in all normal individual in which the heart rate be sufficiently slow to prevent the heart rate obliteration by a normal occurrence in the venous pulse curve from man and the dog . the x wave , while not infrequent , be not always present in man even when the cardiac cycle be of sufficient length to prevent its obliteration by a normal occurrence in the venous pulse curve from man and the dog . a diastolic wave have not be observe in the dog that can be refer to a contraction of the sinus region of  the heart . there be no wave on the venous pulse curve of the dog that can be refer to a contraction of the sinus region of  the heart , while capable of irritability , conductivity and rhythmicity -lrb- erlanger and blackman -lrb- i6 -rrb- -rrb- . extra-systole from stimulation of the venous region of the dog that can be refer to a contraction of the sinus region of  the heart heart produce the venous region of   the dog that can be refer to a contraction of the sinus region of  the heart heart a contraction of the sinus region of  the heart pronounce to be record on a venous pulse trace . after a interval of from 0.07 to 0 . the dog that can be refer to a contraction of the sinus region of  the heart the latent period of             a a wave follow by ventricular systole after the usual a-c interval             a a wave follow by ventricular systole after the usual a-c interval the dog that can be refer to a contraction of the sinus region of  the heart extrasystole from stimulation of the right auricle show , after a interval follow the stimulus much shorter than that note above and represent the latent period of            a a wave follow by ventricular systole after the usual a-c interval a a wave follow by ventricular systole after the usual a-c interval . stimulation of the right auricle show , after a interval follow the stimulus much shorter would seem probable that the sinus region of  the heart , while capable of irritability , conductivity and rhythmicity -lrb- erlanger and blackman -lrb- i6 -rrb- -rrb- , conductivity and rhythmicity -lrb- erlanger and blackman -lrb- i6 -rrb- -rrb- , do not normally manifest contractility . 
1 . carbon monoxide '' rabbit react in general as guinea-pig react . 2 . the increase specific gravity of the blood in '' carbon monoxide '' rabbit be due wholly to the increase in the number of erythrocyte and of hemoglobin , and not to any change in the plasma . 3 . Weigert 's law of inertia , that production would continue after the stimulus have cease to act , do not hold in the case of  carbon monoxide '' rabbit stimulate carbon monoxide '' rabbit . 4 . hemolysin , precipitin and agglutinin towards normal rabbit corpuscle and serum be not present in carbon monoxide '' rabbit . 5 . '' Hemopoeitin '' or anything of a similar nature be not find in rabbit in any stage of erythrocyte degeneration or regeneration . 
1 . Adrenalin inject intraperitoneally increase the rapidity of the peritoneal fluid the absorption of fluid or be approximately isotonic with the blood serum . the intravenous injection of adrenalin also increase the absorption of fluid , but not so markedly as do the intraperitoneal injection . 2 . Adrenalin inject either intraperitoneally or intravenously increase the quantity of sodium chloride absorb . the relative absorption of sodium chloride-the movement from the peritoneal cavity of sodium chloride absorb , as compare with the movement of water-is slightly increase Adrenalin 0.85 per cent . of sodium chloride absorb solution and adrenalin be inject intraperitoneally ; but it be diminish when adrenalin be inject intravenously , or when 1.5 per cent . sodium chloride solution , in such proportion as we use in we infusion experiment , in which we determine the transudation into     the peritoneal fluid and adrenalin be inject . when distilled water have be inject intraperitoneally , adrenalin decrease the relative amount of sodium chloride in the peritoneal fluid-a fact that be evidently related to the increase elimination of sodium chloride absorb through the kidney under the influence of adrenalin . 3 . when 0.85 per cent cent . sodium chloride solution , in such proportion as we use in we infusion experiment , in which we determine the transudation into     the peritoneal fluid be inject into   the peritoneal fluid , the blood , which gradually return to normal become dilute after two hour and a half . when adrenalin be also inject , the dilution of the blood , which gradually return to normal be less marked , in spite of the increase absorption under the influence of adrenalin . when distilled water be inject into   the peritoneal fluid , the blood , which gradually return to normal be dilute equally in control and adrenalin experiment . when 1.5 per cent cent . sodium chloride solution , in such proportion as we use in we infusion experiment , in which we determine the transudation into     the peritoneal fluid be inject , the dilution of  the blood , which gradually return to normal be very slight , and in control and adrenalin experiment sodium chloride solution , in such proportion as we use in we infusion experiment , in which we determine the transudation into     the peritoneal fluid be the same as in control and adrenalin experiment or very slightly greater than in control and adrenalin experiment . 4 . the increase of absorption from the peritoneal cavity cause by the intravenous injection of adrenalin be not due to the increase diuresis cause by the injection of this substance . 5 . the intravenous injection of adrenalin cause a temporary increase in the osmotic pressure of the blood , which gradually return to normal , which gradually return to normal . under certain condition , after the intravenous injection of adrenalin , there be a tendency toward maintain the higher osmotic pressure of the blood serum , even up to the end of the experiment . we have reason to believe that the main factor in increase    the absorption of fluid from     the peritoneal fluid be the main factor in increase the absorption of fluid from   the peritoneal fluid . 6 . in we experiment sodium chloride solution , in such proportion as we use in we infusion experiment , in which we determine the transudation into     the peritoneal fluid have be inject intraperitoneally , either with or without adrenalin , there exist a tendency of the peritoneal fluid to attain a greater osmotic pressure than the blood serum , in spite of the fact that the inject fluid be slightly hypotonic as compare with the blood serum . we note a similar condition in case of general edema in man , in which the osmotic pressure of the ascitic fluid be greater than that of the other edematous fluid , or even that of the blood serum . there exist , therefore , a mechanism that cause the passage of osmotically active substance from  the blood , which gradually return to normal , which gradually return to normal or from the tissue into   the peritoneal fluid , and that cause the osmotic pressure of the peritoneal fluid to become higher than that of the other edematous fluid , or even that of   the blood serum . a mechanism that cause the passage of osmotically active substance from   the blood , which gradually return to normal , which gradually return to normal or from the tissue into     the peritoneal fluid , and that cause the osmotic pressure of   the peritoneal fluid to become higher than that of   the blood , which gradually return to normal , which gradually return to normal follow from we experiment that a mechanism that cause the passage of osmotically active substance from   the blood , which gradually return to normal , which gradually return to normal or from the tissue into     the peritoneal fluid , and that cause the osmotic pressure of   the peritoneal fluid to become higher than that of   the blood , which gradually return to normal , which gradually return to normal , which cause the ascite in edematous person to have such a high osmotic pressure , be not dependent upon certain pathological change in the lining membrane or upon other pathological condition , but exist already in normal animal . 7 . the addition of 1.22 per cent . calcium chloride solution to 0.83 per cent . sodium chloride solution , in such proportion as we use in we infusion experiment , in which we determine the transudation into     the peritoneal fluid , in such proportion as we use in we infusion experiment , in which we determine the transudation into   the peritoneal fluid , delay the absorption of fluid from   the peritoneal fluid but very slightly . therefore , calcium chloride increase directly the transudation into   the peritoneal fluid and do not cause a increase in the amount of fluid in   the peritoneal fluid merely by inhibit the absorption of fluid . 8 . 8 follow that a 
be this thyroid hyperplasium true carcinoma ? in view of the fact that young fish be more affected than old fish , that iodin stop this thyroid hyperplasium and cause this thyroid hyperplasium to return to the colloid state , that removal of the fish from the pond to the open brook also affect a cure , that the clinical incidence of tumor be directly related to the water supply , and that the severity of the disease as determine by histological examination be likewise directly related to the water supply , we can not accept the prevail opinion that the disease as determine by histological examination be true cancer . on the other hand , we believe that a extreme illustration of endemic goitre , the end stage of which be cretinism be a extreme illustration of endemic goitre , the end stage of which be cretinism . the opinion that the other hand be cancer be base purely on anatomical studies-the essential fact be that the grow thyroid invade bone , muscle , etc. . such finding in mammalian tissue be strong evidence of malignancy , but this standard can not be apply to fish thyroid for the reason that any growth of a widely and loosely distribute nonencapsulated gland would give the histological appearance of invasion of the surrounding tissue . the general view as to the cause of the disease as determine by histological examination may be divide into two group : -lrb- I -rrb- infectious and -lrb- 2 -rrb- metabolic . take up the infectious theory , there be abundant grounds for such a view when one consider the flora of the tank . the very careful histological examination by Hofer , Bonnet and pick have yield uniformly negative result . direct infection can not be exclude , but the fact that fish place in the tail-race recover spontaneously , although live in the theoretically most polluted water , be not in harmony with we present conception of water-borne infection . take up the metabolic theory , the three factor of overfeeding , overcrowding and limited proportional water supply together with the many possibility into which the tail-race be divisible seem to we to be in some way , still obscure , directly concern with the development of the disease as determine by histological examination . it be not probable that a single substance , whether the result of food decomposition or of excretory product , excite the grow thyroid to a single substance activity but rather that the thyroid reaction be the thyroid reaction . 
the present paper deal with a comparison of the condition which determine the fate of transplant tumor and of a transplant normal tissue capable of growth . mouse embryo and mouse-tumor be employ as material . it be show that individual differ as host for transplant embryo , some be naturally resistant to transplant embryo growth , and some favorable , just as be know to be the case where tumor be concern . the fate of implant tumor depend directly on whether the fate of implant tumor elicit from the host a vascularize stroma . so , too , the fate of implant tumor be with implant embryo . furthermore mouse-embryo , like mouse-tumor , when introduce into rat call forth a stroma and grow for a brief period . in attempt to answer the question as to whether individual favorable -lrb- or resistant -rrb- to implant tumor be likewise favorable -lrb- or resistant -rrb- to implant embryo , it be show that the factor of age , nutritive condition , and race , which be potent in determine a animal 's status as a tumor-host , act similarly in determine that for embryo . use embryonic tissue and a method which have prove effective for the production of immunity to implant tumor , a immunity to implant embryo be bring about . a immunity to  implant embryo manifest a immunity to  implant embryo in the same way as that for implant tumor , namely , by a absence of the stroma-reaction necessary to life of the engraft tissue . these result demonstrate how implant tumor obey in implant tumor adaptation to a new host and growth therein , the general law regulate a transplant normal tissue . besides the phenomenon here deal with many other that have hold the attention of worker with transplantable tumor be probably not peculiar to neoplasm . the present finding emphasize the importance of the tumor-problem as a tissue-problem ; and many other further indicate how essential the importance of the tumor-problem as a tissue-problem be in cancer work to discriminate between character unique with tumor and those which the importance of the tumor-problem as a tissue-problem possess in common with normal tissue . 
the daily drinking of three liter of the water , for a period of five day , by a man twenty-two year of age who be in a condition of nitrogen equilibrium through the ingestion of a uniform diet , be productive of the follow finding : 1 . a increase in body weight , aggregate two pound in five day . 2 . a increase excretion of urinary nitrogen , the excess nitrogen be mainly in the form of urea , ammonia , and creatine . 3 . a decrease excretion of creatinine and the coincident appearance of creatine in the urine . the decrease creatinine output be believe to indicate that the copious water drinking have stimulate protein catabolism . the coincident appearance of creatine in the urine be consider evidence that the water have cause a partial muscular disintegration result in the release of creatine , but not a partial muscular disintegration result in the release of creatine . the output of creatine be , therefore , out of all proportion to the increase in the excretion of total nitrogen . 4 . a increase output of ammonia which be interpret as indicate a increase output of gastric juice . 5 . a decrease excretion of fece and of fecal nitrogen , the decrease in the excretion of fecal nitrogen being of sufficient magnitude to secure a lowered excretion of both the bacterial and the non-bacterial nitrogen . 6 . a decrease in the quantity of bacterium excrete daily . 7 . a increase in the percentage of total nitrogen appear as bacterial nitrogen . 8 . a lower creatinine coefficient . 9 . a more economical utilization of the protein constituent of a uniform diet . 10 . the general conclusion to be reach as the result of this experiment be to the effect that the drinking of a large amount of water with the water be attend by many desirable and by no undesirable feature . 
gravimetric determination be record for the total and several individual protein -lrb- in the sodium oxalate plasma -rrb- fraction with ammonium sulphate and sodium chloride . at precipitation , the plasma salt mixture have be dilute to a final volume of ten time the amount of plasma employ . coagulation be on aliquot portion of filtrate , and the individual protein constituent -lrb- except serumalbumin -rrb- be calculate by difference . the eleven horse have be subject to simultaneous immunization against diphtheria and tetanus toxin , each horse be subsequently continue on the toxin to which eleven respond best . test bleeding of about 500 cubic centimeter only be make until the maximum antitoxic potency have be attain ; routine bleeding of four to ten liter for antitoxin production be then institute . the two refractory , one medium and the eight horse yield a highly potent antitoxic plasma , all show a increase of from 40 to 114 per cent . in the total serumglobulin . for the refractory animal , 59.3 be 59.3 and 87.9 per cent . in one refractory and in one high horse , the serumglobulin maximum precede the highest concentration in antitoxin . in seven of the horse , the greatest increase in the total serumglobulin be coincident with the maximum antitoxic potency . the greatest increase in   the total serumglobulin , however , tend relatively to precede that of the antitoxin . in the the two other horse , both maximum also be observe together ; no `` intermediate '' bleeding be make in these the two instance . the greatest absolute increase in the total serumglobulin be observe in the most potent plasma obtain in the series ; the second place , however , go to a refractory horse . subsequent to both maximum , the serumglobulin content be maintain at high concentration , in spite of repeat bleeding ; subsequent to  both maximum , the serumglobulin content then only roughly parallel the antitoxic variation in the plasma of the individual animal . at dilution of the plasma in the precipitated mixture of 1:15 , 1:5 and 1:10 , the ammonium sulphate `` euglobulin '' fraction amount to about 60 to 70 , 20 to 24 and 10 to 15 per cent. , respectively , of the total serumglobulin in both the normal and a highly potent antitoxic plasma . in a 850 unit plasma , a increase in the `` euglobulin '' over the normal percentage be observe , but the high content of the protein probably influence the precipitation limit . the influence of the protein concentration be indicate by the different percentage for the `` euglobulin '' obtain for the three dilution of 1:15 , 1:5 and 1:10 . the `` euglobulin '' obtain for the three dilution of     1:15 , 1:5 and 1:10 then be not increase to a greater extent than the `` pseudoglobulin '' as the result of immunization , as have at time be maintain . see pdf for structure this sodium chloride `` euglobulin '' be much greater in normal plasma than the ammonium sulphate `` euglobulin '' at the same dilution . there be a tendency in early immunization for this sodium chloride `` euglobulin '' to increase along with the total serumglobulin ; a tendency in early immunization for this sodium chloride `` euglobulin '' to increase along with   the total serumglobulin rapidly diminish , however , until at the height of immunization and maximum serumglobulin concentration , the height of immunization and maximum serumglobulin concentration may have reach less than half the normal absolute amount . the serum albumin be diminish a third to a half the normal along with the greatest increase in   the total serumglobulin . subsequent to the anti- see    toxic and  both maximum , the serumglobulin content , figure as low as a fifth of the original serumalbumin content have be note . it be suggest that a physiological compensation be a physiological compensation for the greater viscosity of the plasma in the precipitated mixture of 1:15 , 1:5 and 1:10 because of the increase in the more soluble serumglobulin . no characteristic alteration in the fibrinogen of the plasma in the precipitated mixture of 1:15 , 1:5 and 1:10 be observe during immunization . individual variation up to 0.5 gram per 100 cubic centimeter of plasma have be record . the influence of repeat bleeding do not essentially influence the protein change indu 
there exist a far-reaching analogy between the cutaneous trichophytin reaction and the cutaneous tuberculin reaction . both indicate that the seat of a definite infection be the seat of a definite infection or that the seat of a definite infection have pass through such a infection . both may persist for a long time after the active disease have come to rest , indicate that a definite infection have leave the seat of a definite infection in a state of altered reactivity-allergy . under certain condition both may be of diagnostic value , but since the cutaneous trichophytin reaction persist for a long time after a definite infection have pass , the negative reaction may be of greater value , exclude the existence of a specific infection . the cutaneous trichophytin reaction and the cutaneous tuberculin reaction be not only limited to the obvious clinical manifestation , but , as in the cutaneous trichophytin reaction and the cutaneous tuberculin reaction , it can be show that with uniform concentration of antibody , the intensity of the cutaneous trichophytin reaction be dependent on the concentration of       the cutaneous trichophytin reaction and the cutaneous tuberculin reaction . a tentative explanation of the halo formation be offer , base on a rapidly renew formation of antibody stimulate probably by the entrance of a small amount of allergen into the general circulation . 
when a segment of artery , kill by heat , formalin or glycerin be transplant , a segment of artery , kill by heat , formalin or glycerin undergo a rapid degeneration . a segment of artery , kill by heat , formalin or glycerin muscle fiber disappear while the tissue of the host react by build a new wall of connective tissue . when the transplant vessel have be preserve in a condition of latent life , no degeneration of a new wall of connective tissue occur , or a new wall of connective tissue undergo only partial degeneration . a segment of artery , kill by heat , formalin or glycerin muscle fiber can keep they normal appearance , even for a long time after the operation . they normal appearance be , therefore , demonstrate that the artery can be preserve outside of the body in a condition of unmanifested actual life . the best method of preservation consist of place the vessel , immerse in vaselin , in a ice box , the temperature of which be slightly above the freezing point . from a surgical standpoint , the transplantation of preserved vessel can be use with some safety . when the artery be keep in defibrinate blood or vaselin and in cold storage , the proportion of positive result be 75 and 80 per cent. , and this can probably be increase . 
1 . in the experiment record in this paper the influence of the osmotic pressure of the blood upon the absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity become apparent . Nephrectomy , removal of the adrenal , and other operation increase the blood upon absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity and increase the absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity from   the absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity . on the other hand , ether narcosis , at the period at which we test the other hand the influence of the osmotic pressure of the blood upon absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity , cause neither a increase of osmotic pressure of the blood upon absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity nor a increase in the absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity from   the absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity . 2 . the increase osmotic pressure and increase absorption of fluid in nephrectomized animal be to a great extent not a specific effect of the removal of the kidney , but approximately the same condition can be observe after incision of the skin and muscle . 3 . after the uranium nitrate poisoning , complicate factor come into play , and under such condition   the absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity be not increase , notwithstanding the higher osmotic pressure of the blood upon absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity . 4 . in condition in which the blood upon absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity be very high before the sodium chloride solution into the peritoneal cavity -lrb- nephrectomized rabbit or rabbit inject with uranium nitrate three day previously -rrb- , adrenalin cause neither a increase of osmotic pressure of  the blood upon absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity nor a increase in    the absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity , or only a very slight one , in the absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity . on the other hand , one day after the injection of uranium nitrate the blood upon absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity be only slightly increase before the injection of the sodium chloride solution into   the absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity , and here adrenalin cause a marked increase in the absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity from   the absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity . 5 . in nephrectomized animal inject with uranium nitrate the retention of the sodium chloride and other osmotically active substance in the blood upon absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity be not entirely due to interference with the function of the kidney . the retention of sodium chloride may be explain either by a inability of the tissue to bind the sodium chloride and other osmotically active substance or to a diminish permeability of the blood vessel for such substance . 6 . while in nephrectornized animal the elimination of sodium chloride from   the absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity and also from the blood upon absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity be increase , in animal inject with uranium nitrate such a elimination be diminish . this increase in the sodium chloride content of the peritoneal fluid in animal treat with uranium nitrate be accompany by a decrease in the diffusion of other osmotically active substance into   the absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity . 7 . while in nephrectomized animal and in the uranium nitrate animal , adrenalin cause a diminution of the fluid retain in the blood-vessel similar to the diminution note in normal animal , adrenalin no longer exert such a effect at a later stage of the uranium nitrate poisoning . at this period after the administration of uranium nitrate , the retention of fluid in the blood vessel for such substance be apparently equal in the experiment record in this paper with and without the injection of adrenalin , and follow the absorption of   the absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity , the retention of fluid in the blood vessel in the uranium nitrate animal be increase comparatively to a greater extent than in normal animal . 8 . the experiment record in this paper show a marked difference in the distribution of fluid and of osmotically active substance in nephrectomized animal and in the uranium nitrate animal . a marked difference may explain the much greater liability to the development of edema in the uranium nitrate animal . 
I . in normal animal the injection of caffeine , later than that at which we have study the absorption slightly diminish the absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity , in spite of the fact that the amount of fluid and sodium chloride eliminate through the kidney be markedly increase . the lessen the absorption of fluid be due to a slight lowering of the osmotic pressure of the blood which we observe in such animal . II . in nephrectomized animal which receive caffeine than in nephrectomized animal which do not receive this substance caffeine increase the absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity ; the increase in absorption be greater in nephrectomized animal which receive caffeine than in nephrectomized animal which receive caffeine than in nephrectomized animal which do not receive this substance , and the increase in absorption be due to additive increase in the blood which we observe in such animal . in a similar manner , caffeine increase the absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity in animal in which , instead of nephrectomy , other operation , not directly affect the kidney , have be perform . in this case also the increase in absorption be presumably precede by and due to a increase in the blood which we observe in such animal . III . in animal inject with uranium nitrate three day previously , caffeine diminish the absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity , notwithstanding the high osmotic pressure of the blood which we observe in such animal . this agree with the result of we previous experiment in which we find that in animal inject with uranium nitrate three day previously nitrate the absorption of fluid be not increase in spite of the rise of the blood which we observe in such animal . iv . at the time of the conclusion of the absorption experiment , the amount of fluid retain in the vessel be find to be diminish in each series in which caffeine be use . only in certain case can this be due to the increase amount of fluid leave the blood vessel through the kidney ; in other case only in certain case can only be due to a movement of water from the blood vessel into the tissue cause by the injection of caffeine , later than that at which we have study the absorption . v . in normal animal , in nephrectomized animal which receive caffeine than in        nephrectomized animal which receive caffeine than in nephrectomized animal which do not receive this substance and in animal in which a operation not directly affect the kidney have be perform , caffeine cause a absolute and relative increase in the elimination of the sodium chloride from the peritoneal fluid , as a result of which the remain peritoneal fluid show a lessened content of the sodium chloride . caffeine cause also a decrease in the sodium chloride content of the blood which we observe in such animal . we see , therefore , that under the influence of caffeine a greater amount of sodium chloride be eliminate from the body fluid into the tissue cause by    the injection of caffeine , later than that at which we have study the absorption or through the kidney . the factor which cause the sodium chloride to leave the body fluid be probably primarily responsible for the diuresis which take place after the administration of caffeine . in the case of caffeine and other similar substance the diuresis which take place after administration of caffeine be , therefore , in all probability not due primarily to a specific action of the kidney , but to condition which affect the distribution of sodium chloride in the body . VI . the distribution coefficient of other osmotically active substance differ from that of the sodium chloride . other osmotically active substance have a tendency to move into the body fluid in increase quantity under the influence of caffeine . vii . summarize all experiment in which we study the absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity , we may state that change in the blood which we observe in such animal represent the principal factor in explain the variation in the rate of the absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity . viii . there exist no direct relation between a increase in the rate of   the absorption of fluid from the peritoneal cavity and a increase in the amount of urine secrete . if it should be find that even at a period follow the injection of caffeine , later than that at which we have study the absorption of fluid , a rise of the blood which we observe in such animal do not appear , then we may state that the diminution in the amount of edema in the body cavity result from the administration of caffeine be entirely due to a inhibition of the production of edema and not to a increase absorption of fluid from the serous body cavity . 
in summarize the result of THIS work I feel justify in DRAWING the follow conclusion : 1 . the fuchsin body represent a type of body subject to wide variation in morphology and in stain reaction . 2 . though more frequently associate with plasma cell than with any other cell type , these body may and do occur in a great variety of plasma cell . 3 . further , certain section show unmistakable fuchsin body within blood vessel ; some of these body be true hyaline thrombus , while other be due to autolytic change in the red blood corpuscle . 4 . unmistakable fuchsin body be unmistakable fuchsin body . in the former , some of  these body follow closely the distribution of capillary and show a parallel with the change in the extra - and intravascular red blood corpuscle . 5 . the number and type of fuchsin body in tissue can be influence by method of fixation , the number of typical body be inversely proportional to the rapidity and degree of fixation of the red blood cell . 6 . a type of body subject find after the best fixation be not , as a rule , what be consider the typical form , but a irregular fragmentary type or the fuchsinophilic granular form . 7 . the identity in stain the relation to distribution of capillary in granulation tissue , the relation to distribution of capillary in granulation tissue , the relation to distribution of capillary in granulation tissue associate with pigment , the intravascular occurrence , and , finally , the close relation to pigment deposit , all indicate conclusively that unmistakable fuchsin body arise from the extra - and intravascular red blood corpuscle . 8 . no theory of origin from plasma cell , or other granular cell , offer a adequate explanation for the origin of unmistakable fuchsin body , nor can any theory prove adequate which do not take into account the red blood corpuscle . 9 . the peculiar association of plasma cell with unmistakable fuchsin body and hemosiderin seem explainable on the assumption that the active factor in   the fuchsin body represent a stage in the metabolism of hemoglobin by a intracellular enzyme , the fuchsin body represent a stage in the metabolism of hemoglobin by a intracellular enzyme , and hemosiderin , one of the product of  the fuchsin body represent a stage in the metabolism of hemoglobin by a intracellular enzyme be the active factor in the fuchsin body represent a stage in the metabolism of hemoglobin by a intracellular enzyme , the fuchsin body represent a stage in the metabolism of hemoglobin by a intracellular enzyme , and hemosiderin , one of the product of the fuchsin body represent a stage in the metabolism of hemoglobin by a intracellular enzyme . 
1 . by follow the method of Osborne , Mendel and Harris , we can obtain a extremely potent toxin from the castor bean . 2 . 2 would appear , as a result of testing this preparation at the end of two and a half year , that the agglutinating function and the toxic function be the agglutinating function and the toxic function . 3 . a result of testing this preparation at the end of two and a half year be also bear out by the behavior under the electric current ; either we be deal with two different substance or else with a single substance with two distinct toxiphore group , one of which be stable and the other labile . 
1 . anaphylaxi or allergy of rabbit against horse serum can be prove by subcutaneous test . 2 . the test be the test . the skin of the animal , preferably of the abdomen or flank , be shave . -lrb- this should be do a few hour before the injection . -rrb- the injection be make by means of a small hypodermic syringe and intradermally . a effort be make not to inject horse serum under the skin of the animal . those injection be consider most favorable by which horse serum remain as a small bleb in the skin proper . undiluted horse serum be use for most of the experiment . the amount inject vary from 0.0 I cubic centimeter to I cubic centimeter . the reaction seem as definite after 0.0 I cubic centimeter to I cubic centimeter as after a larger quantity . see pdf for structure 3 . the specific reaction appear in from twelve to twenty-four hour after the test be make and reach the specific reaction maximum in from twenty-four to thirty-six hour . the specific reaction consist of a local swell extend from 0.5 to 2 centimeter from the point of inoculation . the skin involve in the raise area be usually red and hotter than the surround skin . macroscopically and microscopically the react area have the appearance of a local acute inflammation . 4 . the altered reactivity -lrb- allergy -rrb- or hyper-susceptibility -lrb- anaphylaxi -rrb- set in usually in from ten to fifteen day after the first injection of horse serum , and last at least three month . individual rabbit show marked variation from the average time of the development of anaphylaxi . 5 . the appearance of precipitine against horse serum in the blood of individual rabbit appear nearly synchronously with the allergic condition . 6 . after large injection of serum the allergic rabbit still react subcutaneously . a suppression of allergy which would correspond to the so-called anti-anaphylaxis could not be prove . 7 . also in regard to the offspring of inject rabbit the subcutaneous test be not positive . the young of inject rabbit do not develop a more active allergy than the young of normal rabbit . 8 . neither the injection of considerable quantity of horse serum nor the development of a marked local reaction in the skin of the animal after intradermal inoculation of horse serum in a sensitize rabbit be accompany or follow by greater variation in the number or type of leucocyte in the circulate blood than be find in control animal . 
the result obtain show that adrenalin , transfusion with salt solution , and the inhalation of tobacco smoke cause a increase circulation in the coronary vessel . Amyl nitrite and nitroglycerin produce the opposite effect . digitali , strophanthus , caffeine , and theobromine give no change in the velocity of circulation . we can conclude from the result obtain that the main element which influence coronary circulation , while the other factor play only a minor part in its variation be the main element which influence coronary circulation , while the other factor play only a minor part in the main element which influence coronary circulation , while the other factor play only a minor part in its variation variation . 
these experiment show that it be possible to cause , by a very high degree of fatty change in the liver with a minimum of necrosis , a very high degree of fatty change in the liver with a minimum of necrosis , involve alike both peripheral and central portion of the lobule and thus eliminate the '' factor of safety '' or residual normal cell . nevertheless , it be find that such fatty liver tissue have not lose in the least the least power to oxidize uric acid when act upon a very high degree of fatty change in the liver with a minimum of necrosis in vitro with abundant air supply , nor be the least power to oxidize uric acid when act upon a very high degree of fatty change in the liver with a minimum of necrosis in vitro with abundant air supply to oxidize xanthine to uric acid noticeably diminish . since these two enzyme , and especially the uricolytic enzyme , be about the last to appear in the development of the animal kingdom and also of the individual mammal , two be to be expect that the will be among the first of these two enzyme to be destroy by injurious agency , but evidently the be not affect by condition that lead to the highest degree of fatty metamorphosis of the cytoplasm of the hepatic cell . while these experiment merely prove that extreme fatty degeneration do not destroy or appreciably diminish the power of the liver cell to oxidize uric acid and xanthine in vitro , yet the suggest that in general fatty degeneration be probably not essentially incompatible with a high degree of metabolic activity by the affected cell . it be possible that in the living tissue functional activity may be decrease secondarily by fatty metamorphosis of the cytoplasm of the hepatic cell , as , for example , by the enlarged fatty cell compress the capillary and reduce circulatory activity , or by modification of diffusion through the cell by the fat deposit , independent of any deleterious influence upon the cellular enzyme the . other experiment will be require to determine whether steatogenic poison leave intrahepatic enzyme other than the uricase equally unaffected , but as the uricase equally unaffected have already be show by Jacoby that the autolytic enzyme and aldehydase in the liver cell be not destroy by phosphorus poisoning , and Abderhalden and Schittenhelm * find that peptid be hydrolyze fully as rapidly by phosphorus liver as by normal liver , it seem probable that extreme fatty metamorphosis be not associate with any serious injury to the enzyme by which the liver cell perform Abderhalden and Schittenhelm * find that peptid be hydrolyze fully as rapidly metabolic function , with the possible exception of those enzyme concern with the metabolism of fat . 
1 . rabbit can be infect in the testicle with the spirocheta of yaw as well as with those of syphilis and the infection can be continue through successive generation in pure culture . 2 . the infection show the infection by enlargement of the testicle with the spirocheta of yaw and the presence of a nodule vary in size from that of a pea to that of a olive . the infection consist in a necrosis of the tubule , a infiltration of round cell and the new formation of a edematous connective tissue . 3 . the complement fixation reaction occur in rabbit infect with yaw as well as in those infect with the spirocheta of syphilis . 4 . this lesion make possible the investigation of the problem of cultivation , of immunity and of treatment . 
1 . Hemosiderin may be produce outside of the animal body and be increase in the liver of rabbit , during autolysis , for a period of from twenty-four to forty-eight hour . 2 . post-mortem hemosiderin formation be most marked in part of liver expose to air , and hemosiderin be , apparently , a oxidation product of the hemoglobin . 3 . Hemosiderin be derive from hemoglobin directly and not from hematin as a intermediate product . 4 . the later stage of autolytic change show that the acid product of proteid autolysis , especially the phosphorus acid , be capable of produce a cleavage of hemosiderin and unite with the iron to form a new series of product which react microchemically for both phosphorus and iron . in such cleavage , pigment analogous to the bile pigment be form . 5 . the relationship observe between hemosiderin and hematoidin be such as would indicate that hematoidin be the pigment matter of hemosiderin . 6 . further , it seem probable that the vital cycle of hemoglobin metabolism in the liver of rabbit be largely intranuclear ; the hemoglobin be convert into hemosiderin either within the nucleus or cell protoplasm ; the iron of hemosiderin and hematoidin be bind by a acid radicle of the nucleo-proteid , and the hematoidin be excrete as bile pigment . 
deprive the bronchial muscle of one side of the lung of they motor innervation do not interfere with sensitization nor the production of the typical anaphylactic lung . there be , therefore , direct sensitization of the muscle substance . complete degeneration of the vagus nerve , after sensitization have occur , interfere in no appreciable way with the course of immediate anaphylaxi . partial degeneration of the vagus nerve , so that the bronchodilator fiber be still physiologically active , after sensitization have take place , exert no effect on the symptom and lung picture of immediate anaphylaxi -lrb- very acute anaphylaxi with death after some minute -rrb- . no definite evidence be obtain regard the function of the motor nerve ending in the bronchial muscle in anaphylaxi . the two side of the lung in immediate anaphylaxi may occasionally be unequal ; when this occur , the left side , especially the left side , be usually fuller than the right side . 
the pure culture be cultivate upon special media from the human tissue in these four case . the nature of the growth , morphological character and tinctorial property do not differ for any of the pure culture and correspond closely to the bacillus in the human leprous tubercle . that the bacillus of these four case will multiply and continue to do so indefinitely outside of the animal body be first demonstrate by Clegg who cultivate a acid-fast organism from leprosy tissue in the presence of ameba and morphological character symbiotic . not only have I be able to confirm Clegg who cultivate a acid-fast organism from leprosy tissue in the presence of ameba and morphological character symbiotic work , but in addition I have succeed in grow the bacillus in pure culture and in reproduce the disease in the japanese dancing mouse , thereby establish the disease identity . this species of animal acquire the infection in four to six week after intraperitoneal or subcutaneous inoculation with either emulsion of fresh leprous tissue or the pure culture of B. leprae . comparatively few bacillus be necessary to infect the japanese dancing mouse ; and the mode of inoculation do not seem to make any appreciable difference in respect to the nature and time of development of the lesion . the experimental lesion be proliferative in character and identical with those in the human subject . macroscopically those in the human subject appear as glistening , white nodule which , in the early stage of development , resemble miliary tubercle . in I experience neither the pure culture nor the bacillus directly from the human tissue in four case of leprosy have show any evidence of multiplication or give rise to the experimental lesion when inject into the ordinary laboratory animal such as guinea pig , rabbit , guinea pig and rat , although repeat attempt have be make to infect the ordinary laboratory animal such as guinea pig , rabbit ,    guinea pig and rat . B. leprae will not only multiply but I experience will colonize on a plain agar medium seed with a pure culture of encysted ameba -lrb- plate lviii , fig. 5 -rrb- , and upon a agar or banana medium prepare with a I per cent . solution of cystein and tryptophane . colonization occur in the form of glistening , white nodule which , in the early stage of development , resemble miliary tubercle , white colony , one to two millimeter in diameter , in from one to two month incubation . the bacillus in neither  the pure culture nor the bacillus directly from   the human tissue in four case of leprosy be at all time acid-fast and differ only in morphology from those of the tissue in that cystein and tryptophane exhibit a greater variation in the distribution of the chromatin and be longer and more distinctly curved . to prove that the culture obtain from the human tissue of these four case be the culture obtain from the human tissue of these four case the culture obtain from the human tissue of these four case , the follow fact be offer : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the growth feature be distinctive and multiplication take place only under special condition of temperature and medium ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- the complete correspondence in tinctorial property and similarity in morphology to the human tissue of these four case ; -lrb- 3 -rrb- the failure to multiply or produce the experimental lesion in the common laboratory animal ; and -lrb- 4 -rrb- the growth of the culture obtain from the human tissue of these four case and the production of typical leprous lesion in the japanese dancing mouse . the successful cultivation of B. leprae and the fact that the pure culture retain pathogenic property be of command importance in respect to a possible production of a artificial immune serum for combate the infection in four to six week in man . work along this interesting line be already in progress in we laboratory . 
in a spindle-celled sarcoma of the hen , which thus far have be propagate into its fourth tumor generation be report the first avian tumor that have prove transplantable to other individual . a spindle-celled sarcoma of the hen , which thus far have be propagate into its fourth tumor generation be a spindle-celled sarcoma of the hen , which thus far have be propagate into a spindle-celled sarcoma of the hen , which thus far have be propagate into its fourth tumor generation fourth tumor generation . this be accomplish by the use of fowl of pure blood from the small , intimately related stock in which the growth occur . market-bought fowl of similar variety have show this insusceptible , as have fowl of mixed breed , pigeon and guinea-pig . the percentage of successful transplantation have be small , but in other individual develop a tumor a tumor the growth have be fairly rapid . Young chicken be more susceptible than adult . the reinoculation of negative fowl have never result in a growth . throughout , a spindle-celled sarcoma of the hen , which thus far have be propagate into a spindle-celled sarcoma of the hen , which thus far have be propagate into its fourth tumor generation fourth tumor generation have remain true to type . a spindle-celled sarcoma of the hen , which thus far have be propagate into a spindle-celled sarcoma of the hen , which thus far have be propagate into its fourth tumor generation fourth tumor generation be infiltrative and destructive . metastasis have be observe once -lrb- to the heart -rrb- . experiment to determine whether the growth may be transmit by cell-fragment have not yet be make . repeated bacteriological examination have yield negative result . in the growth general behavior , so far as test , the first avian tumor that have prove transplantable to other individual closely resemble the typical mammalian neoplasm that be transplantable . 
we agree with jore and other that not one but many factor may be at work lead to intimal hyperplasium . among many factor may be mention infection , bacterial toxin , organic poison , inflammation and increase arterial tension . the theory of Thoma that the connective tissue develop in the intima be compensatory can not be sustain . from the evidence which we have at hand it be not possible to state that the proliferative change in the intima be uniformly secondary to the weakening of the media . common influence may act simultaneously upon the media and the intima . progressive medial degeneration of the peripheral artery -lrb- moenckeberg 's sclerosis -rrb- be the result of muscle fatigue couple with nutritional disturbance . 
in the vast majority of case examine in this laboratory the result of the Wassermann test be simply confirmatory of the clinical finding , but there be numerous suspicious case , or case in which symptom be present and the patient deny a specific history , in which the Wassermann test be of the greatest value , and this laboratory be in such instance , perhaps , that this laboratory may be regard as `` the court of last resort '' in arrive at a conclusion regard the nature of the condition present . certainly if there be any value in experience and statistics , we be justified in regard the Wassermann test as the most valuable means we possess of diagnose lue , and we experience with the Noguchi modification of the Wassermann test have justify all that have be claim for that method . we believe that we result have prove that by the use of the complement fixation test in the military service it be possible to prevent the enlistment of man suffer from latent lue who would otherwise be enlist ; to control specific treatment by use the use of the complement fixation test in the military service as a index of the efficiency of such treatment ; to clear up the diagnosis of obscure or suspicious case ; and to enable the surgeon to avoid mistake in discharge for disability in case suspect of this disease . owe to the facility with which clinical observation can be make in army , and the control that be possible of test individual , the facility with which clinical observation can be make in army be to be hope that the Noguchi modification of the complement fixation test in the military service will be more widely use than the Noguchi modification of    the complement fixation test in the military service have be in the military service , for which we believe the Noguchi modification of    the complement fixation test in the military service be especially adapt . so far as we be aware the Medical Department of we army be the first to adopt the Wassermann test as a routine diagnostic procedure and to apply the Wassermann test in the case of applicant for enlistment . 
1 . nearly all liver at autopsy contain Fat . 2 . fatty substance in the liver appear chiefly in these two form , as small granule and as globule of various size . 3 . we suppose that small granule indicate the -lrb- protoplasmic -rrb- change commonly speak of as fatty degeneration , and that globule of small size be globule of small size , store up by reason of some pathological change which may be merely temporary . 4 . Fat be oftenest central , least often in the mid-zone . 5 . a heavy deposit of fat be compatible with a competent liver . 6 . intense fattiness , generally globular , occur with intoxication of bacterial and chemical nature , as well as in case where a complex toxin be manufacture by the body-cell . 7 . granular fat occur oftener than globular : 7 affect most often the central zone ; globular affect most often the peripheral . 8 . '' Accidental '' mass of globular fat be find at time , and appear to follow no rule of position : these be comparable to lipoma , which be evidently the result of a pathological process . 9 . we find no deposit of fat characteristic of uremia . 10 we know of no analysis of the liver fat in the granular and globular state respectively : it seem to have be take for grant that the deposit be one and the same . to determine the relationship , if any , between these two form should be the basis of investigation . 
Bicarbonate of soda fed in vary quantity over a period of month have no direct effect upon the catalytic activity of the blood . when feed to rabbit , Bicarbonate of soda fed in vary quantity over a period of month invariably cause a slight albuminurium and occasional cast . the kidney of pregnant animal , especially in the later stage of pregnancy , seem to be more susceptible to this salt , and in some instance there may be complete suppression of urine follow by death . in these case there be a decline in the catalytic activity of the blood similar to that observe in case of acute nephritis , follow the administration of uranium nitrate . the subcutaneous injection of salt be impracticable on account of the slow absorption . in intravenous injection it be important to make observation during the subcutaneous injection of salt and at short interval after the subcutaneous injection of salt have be discontinue , since there be a rapid compensation on the part of the organism with a return of the normal catalytic activity of the blood . the simple dilute effect bring about by the injection of distilled water into the circulation manifest the simple dilute effect bring about by the injection of distilled water into the circulation as a slight transitory decrease in the blood . this must be take into consideration when estimate the effect of the injection of solution of salt upon the catalase of the blood . salt , such as sodium chloride , sodium bicarbonate , sodium sulphate and potassium iodide , sodium sulphate and potassium iodide , such as sulphuric , and alkali , such as sodium hydrate , cause a definite decrease in the blood . a definite decrease vary directly with the concentration of this salt . the organism with a return of the normal catalytic activity of  the blood compensate rapidly and bring about a return to the normal catalytic activity of  the blood . a rapid compensation on the part of the organism with a return of the normal catalytic activity of  the blood become less and less complete as larger quantity or repeat infusion be make . for example , twenty cubic centimeter of a five per cent . bicarbonate of soda solution cause a marked fall in the catalytic action of the blood . this be rapidly recover from in from one to five minute , and then a much more marked fall in the normal catalytic activity of  the blood , require a longer time for compensation , occur after the injection of six cubic centimeter of the same solution . this be of interest to note that sodium sulphate and potassium iodide , which have be show to accelerate the catalytic activity of liver extract in the test-tube , have a inhibiting effect on the catalytic action of  the blood when inject intravenously . this be only another instance of the danger to be encounter from the immediate application of test-tube experiment to the living organism . the inhalation of carbon dioxide gas , even until convulsion be manifest , be without effect on the blood . on the other hand , there be a definite decline in this activity follow the administration of illuminating gas . in this respect we result be directly at variance with those of Jolles . 
nitrogen equivalent to about 35 per cent of the nitrogen intake , though not necessarily derive directly from cent of the nitrogen intake , be daily secrete in the succus entericus in dog on a mixed diet ; about 10 per cent be excrete in the fece . and about 25 per cent be reabsorb . the amount of reabsorb nitrogen-containing material be considerably larger if the bile and pancreatic secretion be include . the metabolic significance of this reabsorption can only be surmise . that the metabolic significance of this reabsorption be probably of great importance be indicate by the fact that in the experiment here record the amount of nitrogen reabsorb equal approximately 25 per the nitrogen intake . 
injection of adrenalin or other substance into the lumbar muscle of rabbit be follow by a rapid absorption in whole or in part of adrenalin or other substance into the lumbar muscle of rabbit . a rapid absorption in whole be not due to the needle be within a vein or to the tear of vein by the needle during a rapid absorption in whole insertion . similar injection into gluteal muscle fail to give reliable result . 
1 . about 19 per cent . of the dry weight of the normal pig testicle be fatty matter . Histologically this fat occur largely in the cell of the seminal tubule , and especially in the sertoli cell . 2 . during spermatogenesis the fat of the sertoli cell pass inward for the nutrition of the spermatid and spermatozoon . during this passage this passage character be alter from a neutral fat to a lipoid . 3 . about 30 per cent . of the dry weight of the cryptorchid pig testicle be fatty material . Histologically this fat lie within the seminal tubule , partially fill the sertoli cell . the spermatogenic cell have completely disappear . 4 . we conclude that the presence of such a excessive amount of fat in the cryptorchid testicle be due to the absence of the spermatogenic cell which normally utilize during they development the fat furnish by the sertoli cell . 
in the cultivation of bacillus leprae the initial multiplication outside the body can not be obtain unless the amino-acid be present in the medium . the amino-acid be believe to be essential nutritive for the initial growth of the organism . the initial growth of the organism have be demonstrate that the primary growth of the leprosy bacillus occur only in the presence of the product of tryptic digestion . hence , putrefactive and other bacterium which be capable of splitting nucleo-proteid into splitting nucleo-proteid end acid product be , in consequence , of value in the isolation and cultivation of the leprosy bacillus . Amebae be not necessary for secure the primary multiplication of the leprosy bacillus upon artificial media and be detrimental since splitting nucleo-proteid feed with avidity upon the leprosy bacillus splitting nucleo-proteid . two method may be employ for recover in culture bacillus lepra from the tissue . in one -lrb- the direct -rrb- , tryptophane or a mixture of albumen and trypsin be employ with a culture medium ; in the other -lrb- indirect -rrb- , bacterial species capable of digest the albumen constituent of a culture medium be introduce into the medium . in both , the end result be identical , since both both provide for the presence of the amino-acid in the medium , without which the primary multiplication of   the leprosy bacillus can not be secure . 
the thyroid gland of mammal can be cultivate outside the body . the proliferate element consist of connective tissue and epithelial cell , the former predominating . connective tissue and epithelial cell survive in culture for two week or longer , which period can be increase by secondary and sometimes by tertiary cultivation . two week be to be note that the method of grow in vitro organ such as the thyroid gland of mammal may come to be use with advantage in the study of the substance concern with the internal secretion of certain gland . 
1 . intravascular agglutination can occur , and be the probable cause of occasional untoward symptom , or even death , follow transfusion of agglutinative blood . in the majority of case , however , the probable cause of occasional untoward symptom , or even death do not occur , or if the probable cause of occasional untoward symptom , or even death do , the probable cause of occasional untoward symptom , or even death cause occasional untoward symptom . this be dependent on the influence of three factor : -lrb- 1 -rrb- concentration of the agglutinin ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- absorption of the agglutinin by a excess of agglutinable cell ; -lrb- 3 -rrb- interference with agglutination by a excess of non-agglutinable cell , so that when clump occur this be microscopic in size . 2 . if , for a give transfusion , i. e. , i. e. , i. e. , can not be obtain , then it be safer to use a person whose serum be agglutinative toward   i. e. cell than one whose cell be agglutinate by   i. e. serum . 3 . test for agglutination , as well as for hemolysis , ought to be make before transfusion . when time do not permit this , one have to weigh the possible danger of agglutination or hemolysis against the danger of let   i. e. go without transfusion . 4 . agglutinable cell when transfuse be take up by the phagocyte in   i. e. blood ; and , for this reason -rrb- a give transfusion of agglutinable blood , even when no accident happen , can be expect to do little permanent good . 
in a series of observation upon the thyroid of brook trout , extend from the time of hatch to fish of four or more year old , we have be able to follow step by step the development of the thyroid hyperplasium . in these hatchery trout , the thyroid overgrowth may be recognize anatomically at the end of the second month of extra-oval life . under the condition in which these fish live , the thyroid overgrowth progressively increase , at first fill the aortic space and then invade the surround bone and muscle . in we a series of observation upon the thyroid of brook trout , extend from the time of hatch to fish of four or more year old , this extension into the adjacent tissue be not recognizable until the fourth month of extra-oval life . the time when invasion of the surrounding tissue be first notice be , of course , subject to great variation in different year and different hatchery , depend on the general hygienic condition , food , water supply , etc. . if the growth continue , as the growth usually do , throughout the rapid grow period of the fish , mechanical factor , it may first be detect clinically by a reddening of the pharyngeal floor as the thyroid tissue spread to the submucosa . later , definite external goitre appear ventrally . these may be present as early as the sixth month of life . the thyroid be , as in mammal , most active during the rapid grow period of the fish , the greatest number of visible goitre appear during the second and third year of life . in older fish the thyroid be , as in mammal , most active during   the rapid grow period of the fish , the greatest number of visible goitre appear during the second and third year of life . again become less active and there be a tendency toward spontaneous recovery . there be no noteworthy change in the anatomical appearance of the thyroid growth , whether see in very young or in older fish , other than that clearly dependent on the age of the fish , mechanical factor , mechanical factor , as size of the goitre , and complicate factor , as infection , hemorrhage , degeneration , etc. . there exist , therefore , no anatomical basis for the diagnosis of cancer in the older fish that be not also present in the youngest fish with the thyroid hyperplasium . all the appearance of invasion , atypical cell growth , etc. be the result of the progressive growth and consequent extension of a non-encapsulated epithelial tissue along the path of least resistance . in many of the larger goitre there be more or less distinct area of the thyroid hyperplasium , histologically different from the surround thyroid tissue , which we look upon as benign tumor comparable to the benign tumor see in human goitre . we class many of the larger goitre as benign tumor comparable to the benign tumor see in human goitre because many of the larger goitre do not react with iodin as do the ordinary hyperplasium . to call these tumor cancer be go beyond we present knowledge and be unjustified , even though analogy with mammalian tumor suggest that certain one might proceed to true carcinoma . the most common type of the benign tumor see in human goitre be the most common type of   the benign tumor see in human goitre and the most common type of   the benign tumor see in human goitre many modification . infection be a frequent complication in the larger goitre , for the reason give . it be necessary to recognize this factor in interpret the histological condition meet with , as otherwise , use mammalian standard , some of the appearance observe could easily be mistake for sarcoma . the effect of iodin on the thyroid hyperplasium have be study in the early , middle , and the late stage . all stage react with iodin , the mild degree seemingly more rapidly than the severer degree . thus the early stage undergo involution in from two to three week , while the late stage may require one to two month . the process , therefore , be slower than the iodin reaction time in mammalian hyperplasium . true benign tumor comparable to the benign tumor see in human goitre do not react with iodin as do ordinary hyperplasium . infection or other complication modify the reaction . a specific test for functional hyperplasium of  the thyroid be , as in mammal , most active during   the rapid grow period of the fish , the greatest number of visible goitre appear during the second and third year of life . be a specific test for functional hyperplasium of the thyroid be , as in mammal , most active during   the rapid grow period of the fish , the greatest number of visible goitre appear during the second and third year of life . . as we have not be able to find any stage in the process that do not react with iodin , we must conclude that there be none that may be look upon biologically as cancer . just as iodin invariably stop the thyroid hyperplasium and cause the thyroid to return to the colloid or rest state -lrb- from which the colloid may undergo hyperplasium a second , third , or more time , exactly as in mammal -rrb- , so also spontaneous involution occur when the 
1 . 1 have be show that hemoglobin in solution or within the red blood corpuscle can be oxidize by hydrogen peroxid to form a colorless substance capable of manifest a microchemical reaction for iron , the type of a microchemical reaction depend upon the degree of oxidation . 2 . 2 have be further show that hematin and hemin , when treat with hydrogen peroxid , be decolorize . the colorless or nearly colorless body , preserve the form of the original body and be a intermediate product of the form of the original body oxidation , will also exhibit a typical reaction for iron . 3 . a method have be describe for obtain microchemical reaction for iron from hemoglobin and iron from hemoglobin various modification and iron-containing derivative , from tissue cell , from cell nucleus , and from eosinophil granule , by a appropriate degree of oxidation with hydrogen peroxid . 
this investigation be very limited and the number of patient treat be yet the follow conclusion may not be amiss , yet the follow conclusion may not be amiss : - 1 . the vaccine in no instance do harm , and the reaction in the majority be very mild and of short duration . 2 . case in which bacteriologically B. dysenteria be prove to be present , but in a clinically unrecognizable form , be not affect differently from those which be culturally negative . this may in part be due to the fact that this mode of vaccination produce a immediate passive immunity , while the bacterial vaccine be produce a active immunity . 3 . the work be of interest and hold out a possible means of prevent the great mortality from infantile dysentery during the summer month . 
1 . the transplantable sarcoma of rat and mouse grow very readily by the method of cultivate tissue in vitro . 2 . sarcomatous tissue grow in conformity to a type which may be regard as characteristic for tissue of mesenchymal origin . 3 . the growth of sarcoma cell in vitro consist in ameboid wander into the surround plasma , karyokinetic proliferation . and evidence of active metabolism on the part of sarcoma cell . 4 . mouse carcinoma can be cultivate in vitro . the outgrowth of carcinoma cell assume a sheet-like form , only one cell in thickness . they migrate into the plasma by ameboid movement , the advance edge show numerous prolongation of the cytoplasm into pseudopod . 5 . karyokinetic figure be frequently see in grow carcinoma cell . sarcoma cell show evidence of active metabolism on the part of  sarcoma cell . 6 . both sarcoma and carcinoma cell cultivate in vitro show active phagocytosis ; carmin particle place in the plasma be take up rapidly by grow carcinoma cell . 
1 . sarcoma cultivate in plasma from immune animal grow quite as vigorously as in plasma from normal and tumor-bearing animal , thus afford further proof of the absence of specific cytolytic substance in the body fluid of immune animal immune to transplantable cancer . 2 . immune animal may be successfully inoculate with sarcoma cultivate in vitro , although , in the case of rat sarcoma , there be evidence of diminish virulence . 3 . subculture of sarcoma cultivate in vitro , although , in the case of rat sarcoma , there be evidence of diminish virulence may be make by transfer to fresh plasma the original piece of tissue , or a portion of the outgrowth . the duration of life of sarcoma cell under these condition seem dependent only on a renewal of the medium . 
strychnin and adrenalin when inject into cardiectomize frog be efficiently distribute all over the animal body and when administer in sufficient quantity produce the usual reaction of these alkaloid . the experiment with strychnin prove positively that the paralysing effect of this poison be due to the paralysing effect of this poison direct action upon the nerve cell of the cord , and not , as Verworn assume , to a paralyse action upon the heart . when morphin be inject into cardiectomize frog the effect be much greater and incomparably more rapid than when administer to a normal frog . the normal circulation probably contain substance derive from some organ capable of modify and retard the specific effect of morphin . the distribution of solution in animal deprive of they circulatory apparatus take place through the tissue space , which present a more or less well connected system of communication throughout the entire animal body , especially through the entire animal body peripheral part . this mode of distribution be designate as the peripheral mechanism . in contrast to the centralize cardiovascular apparatus , the peripheral mechanism permit a greater autonomous action of some organ and a more localising effect of injection . the peripheral mechanism find to be active in animal deprive of they the normal circulation be probably identical with the mechanism which serve for distribution of the mesolymph in live animal not yet possess a circulatory apparatus . the existence of the peripheral mechanism in animal with a cardiovascular apparatus possess probably a phylogenetic significance . it be assume that the activity of the peripheral mechanism be probably not completely suppress even in the presence of a normally act circulatory apparatus ; that the activity of   the peripheral mechanism exert a greater physiological influence in its peripheral part in which the normal circulation be normally some-what difficult ; and that the normal circulation unfold a activity in pathological condition in which the normal circulation have be eliminate or reduce in some part of the entire animal body , or in which the energy of the entire circulation have be reduce . 
it may be conclude that the degree of dilution of the culture medium have a marked influence on the rate of growth of splenic tissue . the maximum acceleration be obtain in a medium compose of three volume of normal plasma and two volume of distilled water . the growth in this hypotonic plasma be very much larger than in normal plasma . on the contrary , the growth of the spleen in hypertonic plasma be always less than in normal plasma . in other experiment , we find that in dilute plasma there be also a acceleration of the growth of the skin , on the other hand , the heart , and the liver of chicken . the skin of adult frog also grow more actively in dilute plasma . the optimum degree of dilution vary accord to the nature of the tissue and to the species of the animal . while the plasma contain two fifth distilled water produce the largest growth of splenic tissue , a slightly less diluted medium be more favorable for the liver of chicken and the heart , and generally for the skin , on the other hand also . the action of hypertonic plasma vary also in a large measure . while the spleen in hypertonic plasma do not grow at all in the medium contain 0.0124 and 0.0144 sodium chlorid , the skin , on the other hand , on the other hand , could stand a high concentration of 0.0124 and 0.0144 sodium chlorid . even the largest growth of splenic tissue be activate in media contain 0.0094 and 0.0124 sodium chlorid and be greater than with normal plasma . the spleen of kitten be very easily affect by the change of the dilution of the plasma contain two fifth distilled water , while the skin of the frog present the skin of the frog best growth in plasma contain one half distilled water . marked variation in the sensitiveness of tissue to hypertonic and hypotonic media will probably be observe in animal of different species . from other experiment , three conclusion can be draw : namely , that certain law of growth , discover by Loeb , in lower organism be true also for higher organism ; that normal plasma be not probably its optimum medium ; and that each tissue have probably each tissue optimum medium . the spleen in hypertonic plasma be , without doubt , considerably modify by the variation of the dilution of  the plasma contain two fifth distilled water and perhaps of the osmotic tension of the plasma contain two fifth distilled water . it be possible then that a general law applicable as well to higher form of life - adult frog , cat , and chickens-as , be a general law applicable as well to higher form of life - adult frog , cat , and chickens-as to lower organisms-tubularium and sea-urchin . in place tubularium in different dilution of sea-water and distilled water , Loeb find that the greatest rate of regeneration be observe when two volume of distilled water be add to three volume of sea-water . but fertilize egg of sea-urchin be more sensitive to the action of hypertonic plasma , and sea-urchin all die in a dilution of sea-water with two fifth distilled water . if only one fifth distilled water be add to the sea-water sea-urchin develop normally . we find that the cell of certain tissue of the chicken follow a similar rule , since the maximal growth of the spleen in hypertonic plasma be obtain in plasma contain two fifth distilled water , while other tissue grow better in a less hypotonic medium . normal plasma be certainly not the ideal medium for the growth of certain tissue of the chicken , since slight modification of the osmotic tension of  the plasma contain two fifth distilled water , the alkalinity , or the addition of certain inorganic salt to normal plasma , increase the rate of the growth of certain tissue of the chicken . 
before proceed to a discussion of the experiment upon cold-blooded animal , it be necessary to review briefly some of the work recently do with the bacillus of leprosy . the appearance of the bacillus in man and the bacillus in man behavior under artificial cultivation , and in the tissue of lower animal , should be consider in order that comparison may be draw . in some of the work recently do with the bacillus of leprosy study with the organism under cultivation , Duval and Gurd point out that the long , slender , and beaded appearance of the leprosy the bacillus in man describe by Hansen , in 1872 , be lose when remove for several generation from the parent stem , and under artificial cultivation the organism under cultivation become unbeaded , short , and coccoid . Duval also note that these change in morphology be always follow by rapid multiplication of the organism under cultivation . Duval argue , a priori , that the bacillus in man be not in a favorable environment in the human tissue . if these deduction be correct , the morphology of the leprosy the bacillus in man describe by Hansen , in 1872 should vary accord to the resistance offer by the tissue of different animal . the resistance of the human host to the leprosy the bacillus in man describe by Hansen , in 1872 become more evident in the light of the clinical aspect of the disease . the long period of incubation , the duration of the disease , and the disappearance of the bacillus precede the healing of the infected focus show that the resistance of the human host to   the leprosy the bacillus in man describe by Hansen , in 1872 offer to the bacillus in man by the human tissue be not to be overestimate . this opinion be confirm when the behavior of the leprosy the bacillus in man describe by Hansen , in 1872 bacillus under cultivation and in the tissue of various mammal be compare . when cat , rabbit , bat , guinea pig , and rat be inoculate either below the skin or into the peritoneal cavity with large quantity of bacillus lepra , a slight local reaction follow within twenty-four to forty-eight hour , but no definite lesion be produce and the bacillus precede the healing of the infected focus show that  the resistance of the human host to   the leprosy the bacillus in man describe by Hansen , in 1872 offer to  the bacillus in man by   the human tissue soon disappear . the resistance offer by the tissue of different animal to bacillus lepra be well illustrate by two cat which be inoculate subcutaneously and intraperitoneally with a heavy suspension of bacillus lepra .  the resistance offer by the tissue of different animal be kill and examine three day later , but the bacillus precede the healing of the infected focus show that  the resistance of the human host to   the leprosy the bacillus in man describe by Hansen , in 1872 offer to  the bacillus in man by   the human tissue be not demonstrable from the region about the site of inoculation . pigeon be likewise refractory . it be impossible to cause a local reaction in these bird , and the inject bacillus disappear rapidly . hence , probably no multiplication take place in they . Goats , young pig , and young pig be in a degree susceptible to injection , and though the lesion a be produce , and multiplication of the bacillus precede the healing of the infected focus show that  the resistance of the human host to   the leprosy the bacillus in man describe by Hansen , in 1872 offer to  the bacillus in man by   the human tissue occur , the lesion and bacillus disappear after a limited time . acid-fast bacillus which be recover from the lesion a be long , slim , and beaded , though the organism use in the inoculation be short , unbeaded , and coccoid . monkey inoculate with culture of the short unbeaded form react promptly . the lesion result , though confine in most instance to the site of inoculation , occasionally appear at distant point . the number of bacillus present in the nodule and monkey inoculate with culture of the short unbeaded form arrangement within typical lepra cell show that multiplication have take place . the organism have , however , change from the short coccoid form to the long , slender , beaded form . though the lesion a induce and the bacillus present be in every way similar to those find in man , those find in man tendency to disappear gradually after a quiescent stage clearly denote that the tissue of the monkey , although less refractory than  the resistance offer by the tissue of different animal previously mention , still offer resistance to invasion . while various mammal react but poorly to inoculation of the leprosy the bacillus in man describe by Hansen , in 1872 the bacillus in man , a local reaction manifest the leprosy the bacillus in man describe by Hansen , in 1872 in various way in different species . for example , while multiplication of the organism with the production of the lesion a occur in some species , in other that be more refractory , the inject bacillus assume the involuted or beaded form and do not multiply or produce the lesion a ; in other , still more resistant to the action of the leprosy the bacillus in man describe by Hansen , in 1872 , the organism use in the inoculation quickly undergo granular metamorphosis and disappear . furthermore , in some species the lesion a 
small encapsulated tumor of the size of pea , or even smaller , be occasionally find in the pancreas . small encapsulated tumor of the size of pea , or even smaller be benign , and have a structure similar in all respects to that of a hypertrophied island of langerhan . the distinction between adenomata and form of regenerative hypertrophy , sometimes so difficult to make in the breast , prostate , liver , and other organ , be not easily draw in the present case . the fact that one may encounter all gradation in the size of island , from that of the normal island to that of small encapsulated tumor of the size of pea , or even smaller , suggest that it be more reasonable to consider such tumor merely as hypertrophied island rather than as adenomata originate from island . 
the foregoing experiment clearly justify the follow conclusion : - intratracheal insufflation protect the respiratory tract very efficiently against any invasion from the pharynx . the fill up of the pharynx with extraneous material , whether the fill up of the pharynx with extraneous material be from the stomach or from the mouth , bring no danger to the trachea and bronchus . this hold true even if the animal be under deep anesthesia . on the other hand , the presence of a tube in the trachea or larynx without the protection of a effective recurrent air stream , definitely facilitate the entrance of foreign material from the pharynx into the trachea or larynx without the protection of a effective recurrent air stream , definitely . Anesthesia , which remove the protective action of deglutition , greatly increase no danger from aspiration in these case . 
these experiment have show that salvarsan be a comparatively inactive drug when apply directly to nerve and muscle tissue of the frog . in perfusion experiment with alkaline solution , no detrimental action whatever be to be see either upon direct or indirect irritability . in bathing . perfusion experiment with alkaline solution , no detrimental action , in which the concentration of the salvarsan in the various solution be surely much higher than that in which the concentration of the salvarsan in the various solution reach the peripheral tissue in the human subject through the loss of irritability , the loss of irritability occur only after a long period of exposure to a comparatively inactive drug . 
1 . in we examination , only 38 per cent . of the infection of the respiratory tract below the glottis be pure , and this percentage be reach only by carefully follow Kitasato 's method of handle sputum . 2 . Lobar pneumonia may produce sputum free from pneumococcus , and may undoubtedly be cause by organism other than thepneumococcus . 3 . there be find a marked yearly variation in the organism which excite inflammation of the respiratory tract below . 4 . micrococcus catarrhali be usually consider a common secondary invader ; but micrococcus catarrhali may , and probably frequently do , assume pathogenic property . 
the Wassermann reaction in scarlet fever per se be uniformly negative . the antigen of scarlet fever liver yield practically the same result as the same result of luetic liver , and both fail to deviate complement with scarlet fever antibody . the Noguchi reaction in scarlet fever be practically negative . sixteen case , or 6.4 per cent . of 250 case , be positive when active serum be use ; with inactivate serum , but eleven , or 4.4 per cent. , remain positive . five of these eleven case be also positive with the Wassermann system . in other word , sixteen case , or 6.4 per cent. , be positive accord to the Noguchi system with active or inactivate serum or both , whereas with the Wassermann system only 2 per cent . be positive . the presence of anti-sheep hemolysin normally in human serum be one of the main disturbing factor in the Wassermann system ; for this reason , complement and hemolysin -lrb- make by immunization of rabbit -rrb- require careful titration . a positive Wassermann reaction usually indicate the presence of syphilitic antibody , and a negative Noguchi reaction , complement and hemolysin -lrb- make by immunization of rabbit -rrb- absence , and both system should be use in the examination of all case . 
the intravenous infusion of 0.5 per cent . acid `` 606 '' cause a weakening of the heart which be usually fatal . the intravenous infusion of 0.5 per cent . alkaline `` 606 '' cause no marked apparent effect upon the heart which be usually fatal , but alkaline `` 606 '' factor of safety may be so reduce in some instance that a slight extra strain produce fibrillation and death . 
in the test tube , sodium linoleate and sodium linolenate kill and dissolve virulent pneumococcus more rapidly and in higher dilution than sodium oleate ; otherwise virulent pneumococcus action be sodium linoleate and sodium linolenate kill . the intensity of action on the coccus be directly proportional to the degree of unsaturation of the acid . blood serum inhibit the bacteriolytic and hemolytic action of unsaturated soap partially or completely , accord to definitive quantitative relation between serum and soap . small quantity of serum completely inhibit the action of dilute soap solution , but even whole serum do not prevent bacteriolysis and hemolysis by relatively concentrated soap solution , relatively concentrated soap solution . and 0.5 per cent . a give quantity of serum inhibit the action of the soap in inverse ratio to bacteriolysis and hemolysis the degree of unsaturation of the acid . the hemolytic and bacteriolytic action of soap of the unsaturated fatty acid be probably due in part to bacteriolysis and hemolysis avidity for protein and not wholly to bacteriolysis and hemolysis ability to dissolve lipoid . attempt to prevent serum inhibition of the lytic action of sodium linoleate and sodium linolenate be unsuccessful . the more unsaturated soap be not as efficient in prevent fatal pneumococcic infection of animal as sodium oleate ; otherwise virulent pneumococcus action . 
by repeatedly withdraw , defibrinate , and reinject blood , the platelet count in dog can be reduce to a extremely low level . when the reduction in platelet and fibrinogen have be carry to a extreme degree the animal display a marked tendency to bleed . the regeneration of platelet after they removal by defibrination be remarkably rapid and amount , on a average , to about one fifth of the entire number in the blood per day . from the experiment and from observation on the platelet count in human being , it be believe that under the usual condition of life platelet after they removal by defibrination be utilize or destroy and replace in enormous number daily , and that the life cycle of the platelet be extremely short,-possibly the life cycle of the platelet . 
the contents of the stomach and small intestine of normal rabbit , keep on a diet poor in easily convertible carbohydrate , when remove immediately after kill the animal -lrb- by clamp the trachea -rrb- , usually contain a very small but measurable amount of dextrose -lrb- reduce substance -rrb- . a precede nephrectomy do not increase the amount of the dextrose in these viscera . a intravenous injection of dextrose , if give in a sufficient quantity in a unit of time , cause a definite excretion , or the increase , into the stomach and small intestine of normal rabbit the stomach and small intestine of normal rabbit . the amount of excretion , however , be incomparably smaller than the amount eliminate through the kidney . a precede double nephrectomy increase the gastro-intestinal elimination of the intravenously inject dextrose . the increase , however , be far too small to be consider in the light of a functional compensation for the loss of the considerable elimination through the kidney . 
the follow conclusion MAY be DRAWN FROM a ANALYSIS of the protocol : 1 . the chlorin output be very much diminish during the process of experimental pneumonia in dog -lrb- iii -rrb- . the quantity of chlorin retain in the case with well develop exudate -lrb- table i -rrb- be much larger than the exudate could account for . 2 . turpentine pleurisy in dog -lrb- table iii and iv -rrb- also be associate with a retention of chlorin , but this be not so marked as in pneumonia . there be no direct quantitative relation between the water output and the chlorin excretion . 3 . the rabbit with pneumococcal septicemia -lrb- table v and VI -rrb- do not retain chlorin in any phase of a fact which Hutchison have also notice , a fact which Hutchison have also notice . table v seem justifiable to conclude that the retention of chlorin in the organism in the course of pneumonia be condition by more than one factor . the formation of the exudate be one of these factor , but it alone be not capable of produce the same degree of the retention of chlorin in the organism in the course of pneumonia as occur in pneumonia . the additional factor be not yet determine ; but it may be state that the retention of chlorin in the organism in the course of pneumonia be probably not due to the general effect of the pneumococcus on the organism in the course of pneumonia or to the retention of chlorin in the organism in the course of pneumonia injury to the kidney . the principal cause of the retention of chlorin in the organism in the course of pneumonia seem , therefore , to be due to local change associate with the pulmonary condition . 
a few finding which seem to be of importance may be point out : - Table I show the analytical figure of serum-albumin , serum-globulin , and fibrin of the normal dog . the main difference between albumin and globulin appear in the relation of the precipitable to the non-precipitable total nitrogen and amino-nitrogen . precipitable total nitrogen as well as amino-nitrogen be considerably larger in albumin and globulin than in the globulin . in the case of uranium nitrate nephritis -lrb- table ii -rrb- , the important figure approximate very closely those of   serum-albumin , serum-globulin , and fibrin of the normal dog . the sample from dog 3 , -lrb- 1 -rrb- the amount of amino-nitrogen to the total nitrogen in the solution before precipitation be higher dog 3 , -lrb- 1 -rrb- the amount of amino-nitrogen to the total nitrogen in the solution before precipitation be higher nitrate , show relatively large variation as compare with the figure from specimen from the other dog , chiefly as regard the amino-nitrogen distribution : i. e. , in dog 3 , -lrb- 1 -rrb- the amount of amino-nitrogen to the total nitrogen in the solution before precipitation be higher , -lrb- 1 -rrb- the amount of amino-nitrogen to the total nitrogen in the solution before precipitation be higher ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- the percentage of precipitable amino-nitrogen be larger ; and -lrb- 3 -rrb- the ratio of precipitable amino-nitrogen to precipitable total nitrogen exceed that of the other case . all these change , together with the fact that the total precipitable nitrogen do not undergo any quantitative variation , suggest that in the case of  dog 3 , -lrb- 1 -rrb- the amount of amino-nitrogen to the total nitrogen in the solution before precipitation be higher , -lrb- 1 -rrb- the amount of amino-nitrogen to the total nitrogen in the solution before precipitation be higher the analyze material contain a higher amount of lysin or cystin . the fact that the total precipitable nitrogen do not undergo any quantitative variation may further be mention that the analytical figure in the case of   dog 3 , -lrb- 1 -rrb- the amount of amino-nitrogen to the total nitrogen in the solution before precipitation be higher , -lrb- 1 -rrb- the amount of amino-nitrogen to the total nitrogen in the solution before precipitation be higher differ also from those of serum-albumin , serum-globulin , and fibrin of the normal dog and still more from those of the serum-globulin . these change , however , be not find in the case of dog 4 , although this animal be treat in the same manner as the precede dog . in the case of nephritis in man -lrb- table iii -rrb- , striking difference be meet with in the case of acute scarlet fever nephritis -lrb- no. 1a -rrb- and in the case -lrb- no. 2 -rrb- of a patient with chronic nephritis and Pott 's disease . a patient with chronic nephritis die a few week after the specimen for analysis be collect . the autopsy show a general amyloidosis . relatively large variation as compare with the figure from specimen from the other dog , chiefly as regard the amino-nitrogen distribution : i. e. , in  dog 3 , -lrb- 1 -rrb- the amount of amino-nitrogen to the total nitrogen in the solution before precipitation be higher , -lrb- 1 -rrb- the amount of amino-nitrogen to the total nitrogen in the solution before precipitation be higher ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- the percentage of precipitable amino-nitrogen be larger ; and -lrb- 3 -rrb- the ratio of precipitable amino-nitrogen to precipitable total nitrogen exceed that of the other case consist in a lowering of -lrb- 3 -rrb- the ratio of precipitable amino-nitrogen to precipitable total nitrogen exceed to total nitrogen in the solution before precipitation be higher , and correspond to a fall of the same ratio in the filterable nitrogen , a fall of the same ratio in the filterable nitrogen . such a change point to a relatively larger amount of prolin and oxyprolin or tryptophan in  relatively large variation as compare with the figure from specimen from the other dog , chiefly as regard the amino-nitrogen distribution : i. e. , in  dog 3 , -lrb- 1 -rrb- the amount of amino-nitrogen to the total nitrogen in the solution before precipitation be higher , -lrb- 1 -rrb- the amount of amino-nitrogen to the total nitrogen in the solution before precipitation be higher ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- the percentage of precipitable amino-nitrogen be larger ; and -lrb- 3 -rrb- the ratio of precipitable amino-nitrogen to precipitable total nitrogen exceed that of the other case . as a whole , one may conclude that Van Slyke 's method , carefully apply and sufficiently control , may also be use for the study of urinary albumin . the result already obtain indicate that definite difference in the composition of urinary `` albumin '' may be detect . as yet it be premature to establish a definite relationship between the chemical composition of albumin and globulin and the clinical or pathological condition under which the chemical composition of    albumin and globulin and the clinical or pathological condition appear , but a definite relationship between the chemical composition of    albumin and globulin and the clinical or pathological condition under which the chemical composition of    albumin and globulin and the clinical or pathological condition appear seem hopeful that further work may lead to the finding of such a relationship . 
the physiological study of experimental nephritis cause by the poison demonstrate that the poison may produce type of nephritis in which either vascular or tubular change predominate . diphtheria toxin produce a nephritis which in diphtheria toxin late stage be of the vascular type , but in diphtheria toxin late stage early stage be distinctly tubular . tuberculin and mallein uniformly cause lesion of the tubular type , which do not pass into the vascular type . nephrotoxic and hemolytic immune serum cause physiological change . this discrepancy between the result of anatomical and physiological study indicate that a lesion of the membrane control the passage of fluid may occur without alteration in the power of the vessel to contract and dilate . this fact be show clearly by the lesion cause by hemolytic immune serum , which be in sharp contrast to the lesion cause by diphtheria toxin , since the latter substance not only alter the permeability of the membrane but also influence markedly the power of the vessel of the vessel to contract and dilate . it be necessary therefore if the term `` vascular '' be use in the term `` vascular '' broadest sense , to recognize three type of vascular nephritis : -lrb- 1 -rrb- one in which little or no anatomical evidence of vascular injury be find , but in which           show profound vascular change , as in arsenical nephritis ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- one in which anatomical evidence of vascular -lrb- exudative -rrb- injury be prominent , but in which the physiological test be negative , as in nephritis cause by a hemolytic immune serum ; and -lrb- 1 -rrb- one in which little or no anatomical evidence of vascular injury be find , but in which            show profound vascular change , as in arsenical nephritis ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- one in which anatomical evidence of vascular -lrb- exudative -rrb- injury be prominent , but in which the physiological test be negative , as in nephritis cause by a hemolytic immune serum , as in diphtheria toxin nephritis . 
1 . uranium and cantharidin , in the smallest dose capable of produce a distinct nephritis , tend to increase the elimination of nitrogen , probably by stimulate tissue katabolism . 2 . uranium , cantharidin , and potassium chromate , in larger dose , impair the power of the kidney to eliminate nitrogen ; but this may not be evident unless the animal be on a high nitrogen diet , and the impairment , when due to potassium chromate , may not persist more than a day . 3 . small dose of uranium and of cantharidin cause a transient increase of the chloride elimination which correspond in a general way to the excess of diuresis . 4 . large dose of uranium and of chromate cause a fall , a fall , in the chloride elimination . the chloride elimination may , however , be diminish forty per cent . for twenty-four hour without evidence of intoxication -lrb- vomit -rrb- . 5 . the anatomic appearance of the kidney to eliminate nitrogen vary somewhat with the poison use and greatly with the period of survival after administration of the poison , but bear no definite relation to the nitrogen , chloride , or the elimination of the phenolsulphonephthalein ; marked anatomic alteration be compatible with normal elimination of all these substance and with freedom from the symptom of intoxication -lrb- vomit -rrb- . 6 . the decrease in the elimination of the phenolsulphonephthalein , which occur in uranium , chromate , and cantharidin nephritide , and which , in a general way , be proportional to the dose of the poison , bear no constant relation to the change in the nitrogen or chloride elimination . 7 . a marked decrease in the elimination of the phenolsulphonephthalein test occur synchronously , as a rule , with the onset of the symptom of intoxication -lrb- vomit -rrb- , and therefore the phenolsulphonephthalein test would seem to be a better indicator of the ability of the kidney to eliminate the toxic substance responsible for the symptom of renal insufficiency than be either the anatomic change or the elimination of total nitrogen or of chloride . 
1 . the combination of a biological test object on which adrenalin cause contraction of smooth muscle -lrb- perfused blood-vessel or the uterus in certain condition -rrb- with a biological test object on which the uterus produce inhibition of contraction of smooth muscle -lrb- intestine -rrb- greatly diminish the chance of error in testing blood -lrb- or other body liquid -rrb- for adrenalin . a control experiment with adrenalin solution should , in general , accompany each observation on testing blood -lrb- or other body liquid -rrb- for adrenalin . 2 . when properly choose biological test be employ , no evidence be obtain of the presence of adrenalin in detectable amount in normal blood take from the general circulation . 3 . in a case of nephritis with albuminurium and persistently high arterial pressure , persistently high arterial pressure be diminish by force breathing . the wash out of carbon dioxide seem to be a factor in this diminution as well as the mechanical interference with the general circulation . in a case of nephritis with albuminurium and persistently high arterial pressure , the administration of large dose of sodium bicarbonate be associate with a marked diminution in the blood pressure . 4 . in another case with persistently high blood pressure , the draw off of cerebrospinal fluid cause a distinct diminution in persistently high arterial pressure , presumably by lower the intracranial pressure . no pressor substance be detect in the cerebrospinal fluid . 
from what have already be say , it be apparent that change in respiration and blood pressure may be produce by stimulation of a very large portion of the optic thalamus ; that no one region control these phenomenon ; that the spleen show variation in volume only when mark blood pressure change occur , and that such a change have be observe on stimulation of many place in the thalamus which prove inert to stimulation . furthermore , the region in the thalamus from which such effect be obtain be     the region in the thalamus from which such effect be obtain . the portion of the thalamus which prove inert to stimulation be the portion of the thalamus which prove inert to stimulation           the portion of the thalamus which prove inert to stimulation . these phenomenon be similar in every respect to those observe when a afferent nerve be stimulate . in what have go before , those observe when a afferent nerve be stimulate have be show that the respiratory and circulatory change occur when one of the sensory path , or a path run directly to the medullary nucleus govern these function be stimulate . in explain these phenomenon , therefore , there be no necessity for invoke the existence of special center . 
from result of which the foregoing datum form a part , it appear that a valuable index to intestinal condition be a valuable index to intestinal condition , and the method herein describe be a simple and satisfactory one for make this determination . a part involve three serial centrifugalization of a two gram sample of the fresh fece bring into suspension in 0.2 per cent . hydrochloric acid . the bacterial suspension finally obtain be concentrated and extract by alcohol , and nitrogen be determine in the precipitated material . the complete datum on a give stool can be obtain in about five day , and one operator can take care of three or four stool in duplicate in one day . on a absolutely uniform diet of simple and easily digest food during a period of three to four week , the average amount of bacterial nitrogen in two subject be find to be 53.9 per cent . of the total fecal nitrogen , and this percentage , though higher than this percentage obtain by worker heretofore , be probably more nearly a true value for bacterial nitrogen , because no ether extraction be employ . the average daily amount of dry bacterium , calculate on the basis of the nitrogen value , be 8.27 gram . 
1 . theoretically , the method of cultivate tissue outside the body offer a ideal technique for the demonstration and study of cytotoxin . 2 . mouse sarcoma , which grow vigorously in the plasma of normal rat , show little or no activity in the plasma of rat immunize by mouse sarcoma injection . 3 . rat sarcoma , readily cultivate in the plasma of normal guinea pig , either remain quite inactive , or present a feeble growth in the plasma of guinea pig previously treat with rat tissue . 4 . the inhibition of growth in culture of rat and mouse sarcoma in plasma from animal of a foreign species immunize against rat tissue , be due , in all probability , to the action of cytotoxin . 
the study of a variety of experimental renal lesion in the dog demonstrate that the phenolsulphonephthalein test of Rowntree and Geraghty be one of the most satisfactory and at the same time most delicate method of estimate the kidney , as be show in we study of spontaneous nephritis . the elimination of the test dye be decrease in so-called spontaneous nephritis and in experimental nephritis due to potassium chromate , uranium nitrate , cantharidin , diphtheria toxin , and arsenic , and in those lesion cause by snake venom , hemolytic serum , prolonged renal anemia , and extensive reduction of the kidney substance . the elimination of the test dye the elimination of the test dye be not ' diminish , but be increase , in the presence of the renal lesion cause by nephrotoxic immune serum , and for this discrepancy no explanation be at hand . a reliable method of demonstrate improvement in the functional activity of  the kidney , as be show in we study of spontaneous nephritis , as be show in we study of spontaneous nephritis be a reliable method of demonstrate improvement in the functional activity of the kidney , as be show in we study of spontaneous nephritis , as be show in we study of spontaneous nephritis . the increase elimination of the dye occur after small dose of various irritant , which be frequently characteristic of the early stage of a severe nephritis , and which be see also several day after unilateral nephrectomy , would appear to have a important relation to the problem of kidney function ; and although probably not of clinical importance , a severe nephritis be worthy of further study as a phase of renal activity . 
acute lethal anaphylaxi in the intact rabbit be cause by a failure of the heart a failure of the heart . the heart a failure of the heart be due to a change in the heart a failure of the heart ; a failure of the heart be peripheral and independent of the central nervous system for a failure of the heart production . a change in the heart a failure of the heart be show anatomically and functionally by decrease translucency , decrease translucency , and by failure to respond to stimulus , and be probably to be class as a chemical rigor . the rigor of the heart a failure of the heart be most pronounced in the right ventricle , the wall of which may be gray , stiff , very tough to the finger nail , and non-irritable . cardiac stimulant of the digitali group seem to exert a harmful effect when inject in acute anaphylaxi . blood coagulation be delay ; a loose clot form after one half to two hour . anti-anaphylaxi be produce when the animal do not succumb to the injection . when anaphylactic death be delay for about one hour , a well develop rigor of the white muscle of the thigh , and of the diaphragm may occur while the animal be still alive . reason be bring forward to show the necessity of more caution in employ the word anaphylaxi . Friedberger 's statement , that the lung of guinea pig dead from acute anaphylaxi be not characteristic of anaphylaxi for the animal , be show to be baseless . 
1 . hypertrophy of the island of langerhan occur in two form : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the simple type which be nothing more than a increase in size of preexist island ; and -lrb- 2 -rrb- the columnar type , in which the island of langerhan be compose of anastomose column of cylindrical cell . 2 . regeneration of the island of langerhan take place by means of a bud off of columnar cell from the duct . the process be analogous to the development of the island in the fetal pancreas . 3 . newly form island of langerhan be compose of cylindrical cell similar in all respects to those constitute hypertrophied island of the columnar type . the two structure be identical , the latter be a later phase of the former . 4 . newly form island of langerhan be capable of a greater hypertrophy than preëxisting island . both type of insular hypertrophy be usually of a compensatory character , the columnar , or regenerative type , be the more important . 5 . hypertrophy and regeneration of the island of langerhan occur most frequently in diabetes mellitus -lrb- 34 per cent . of 100 case study -rrb- . these change be usually associate with sclerosis or hyaline degeneration of other island . 6 . hypertrophy and regeneration of    the island of langerhan be occasionally observe in cirrhosis and carcinoma of the fetal pancreas . in some of the most advanced case , however , the island of langerhan have be spare and neither hypertrophy nor regeneration be present . 7 . regeneration of    the island of langerhan have be note in five case in which there be no evidence of diabetes and where the fetal pancreas be for the most part normal . in four of these case , columnar hypertrophy of the island of langerhan be also observe . all five case be associate with abnormality of the larger ducts-obstruction , chronic inflammation , and adenomatous proliferation of the lining epithelium . 8 . the occurrence of hypertrophy and regeneration of    the island of langerhan afford considerable evidence in favor of the larger ducts-obstruction , chronic inflammation , and adenomatous proliferation of the lining epithelium anatomic and functional independence . 
in nearly 50 per cent . of the case , virulent trypanosome virus inoculate directly through the stomach wall of rat fail to infect these animal . the percentage of infection after inoculation of this kind seem to vary with the virus . Surra of India prove to be the most virulent , and caderas the least . nagana and dourine occupy intermediate position . the rat that escape infection show no trace of immunity when test with small quantity of the same virus between the twelfth and the twenty-eighth day after the intra-stomachal inoculation . the majority of the rat test for immunity with surra of India and nagana seem to have acquire , instead of a certain hypersensitiveness , a certain hypersensitiveness to infection . five of the seven nagana rat die before nagana and dourine control . the result of test the vitality of the trypanosome of caderas the least , dourine , and nagana introduce directly into the stomach and intestine of live rat seem to show that both motility and virulence be usually lose in less than two hour . Surra of India prove exceptionally resistant to the harmful influence of the stomach , for in one case , surra trypanosome introduce into the intestine be find to be sluggishly motile in the stomach one hour and fifty-five minute later , and in another instance , surra parasite inject into the stomach be find , when remove from that organ less than two hour , to be actively motile and infectious . 
1 . fresh and inactivate animal serum under proper condition will bind pepsin quantitatively in weak acid solution and will prevent serum under proper condition from digest proteid even after the addition of free hydrochloric acid in excess . 2 . this binding and inactivation of pepsin can not be consider as due to a specific anti-pepsin . 3 . the phenomenon have be name pepsin deviation in analogy with the deviation describe for other ferment , notably trypsin . 4 . the ability of animal serum to deviate pepsin have be responsible for most , if not all , of the publish account of a specific anti-pepsin . 5 . by the use of a technique elaborate to control pepsin deviation , the use of a technique have be find impossible to demonstrate normal anti-pepsin in the blood serum of the dog , cat , guinea pig , beef , horse , rabbit , and of man . 
the result of these experiment show , in short , that , by the method employ , adrenalin could neither be demonstrate in the specimen of blood , nor in either of the two specimen of malignant hypernephroma , nor in the specimen of metastatic tissue from the adrenal tumor which closely resemble a malignant hypernephroma . the result of these experiment agree with those of Greer and Wells in show that no adrenalin be find in malignant renal hypernephroma ; and the further observation be make that no adrenalin content of the blood of a patient with malignant renal hypernephroma could be show by the rabbit uterus strip test . those rare tumor which arise from medullary adrenal tissue might be expect to contain adrenalin ; but as point out by Greer and Wells , since the ordinary malignant renal hypernephroma arise from adrenal rest which consist of cortical tissue , and since the cortex of adrenal contain no adrenalin , no adrenalin should be expect in the tumor arise from such cortical tissue . 
1 . I have propose the name luetin for a emulsion or extract of pure culture of treponema pallidum which be design to be employ for obtain , in suitable case , a specific cutaneous reaction that may become a valuable diagnostic sign in certain stage or form of syphilitic infection . 2 . the repeat inoculation of either living or kill pallida into the testicle of rabbit lead to a condition in which a intradermic injection of luetin be follow by a well marked inflammatory reaction . a corresponding reaction have be obtain neither in rabbit suffer from active syphilitic orchitis , nor in those in which a condition in which a intradermic injection of luetin be follow by a well marked inflammatory reaction have be cure by the administration of salvarsan four month previously . normal rabbit , likewise , do not react to the name luetin . 3 . the name luetin produce a similar cutaneous reaction in syphilitic and parasyphilitic patient that be most constant and severe in the tertiary and hereditary affection . in I series of suitable case , I series of suitable case be present constantly -lrb- 100 per cent . -rrb- in the manifest tertiary affection , in 94 per cent . of latent tertiary affection , and in 96 per cent . of the hereditary affection . 4 . during the primary and secondary stage , a similar cutaneous reaction in syphilitic and parasyphilitic patient that be most constant and severe in the tertiary and hereditary affection be infrequent , and when present a similar cutaneous reaction in syphilitic and parasyphilitic patient that be most constant and severe in the tertiary and hereditary affection be of mild degree . a exception have be find in suitable case in which energetic treatment have be or be be carry out and in which clinical sign of syphilis be absent . such case may show a severe reaction . apparently this be true especially of the case treat with salvarsan . 5 . in certain case of old infection in which no treatment have be take and in which no symptom have appear for many year , and in the course of which miscarriage have not occur , a specific cutaneous reaction that may become a valuable diagnostic sign in certain stage or form of syphilitic infection have fail to appear . but , despite the absence of no symptom , mother who have young syphilitic child have usually give a similar cutaneous reaction in syphilitic and parasyphilitic patient that be most constant and severe in the tertiary and hereditary affection . 6 . 6 remain to be determine in how far the cutaneous reaction with luetin can be use to supplement the Wassermann reaction in determine the complete and permanent suppression of a syphilitic affection . 7 . it appear probable that the Wassermann reaction be more constant in the primary and secondary , and the cutaneous reaction in the tertiary and latent form of syphilis . moreover , it appear that the Wassermann reaction be more directly and immediately affect by antisyphilitic treatment than be a specific cutaneous reaction that may become a valuable diagnostic sign in certain stage or form of syphilitic infection . 8 . a more active preparation of luetin can certainly be produce by improve method . this phase of the subject be be consider at the present time and will be report upon in a later paper . 
the maintenance of life of a individual with a open double pneumothorax under differential pressure depend essentially upon the normal position of the lower lobe of the lung and they close approximation to the diaphragm , especially of the posterior part of the lower lobe of the lung and they close approximation . a complete dislodgment of both lower lobe lead invariably to the death of a individual with a open double pneumothorax under differential pressure , which may occur in a very short time , or after fifteen to twenty-five minute . in all case the respiration be affect first ; the respiration slow almost at once and stop invariably before the heart . the result be the result whether the vagus be intact or both nerve be cut . exceptionally , respiration may continue even after the separation of the lung from the diaphragm , but only by have all the lobe well approximate to the thoracic wall . when by both lower lobe the respiration be stop and the heart be feeble and slow , or stop completely , it be rarely possible to restore life by artificial respiration or by other appropriate means . the extent of the exchange of gas occur in normal respiration , with closed thoracic cavity , exceed greatly the need for the maintenance of life of a individual with a open double pneumothorax under differential pressure , since normal respiration be provide with a abundance of factor of safety . under differential pressure , however , life be carry on with a exchange of gas which amount to a small fraction only of the exchange of gas occur in normal respiration that take place in normal respiration ; respiration under differential pressure be , therefore , deprive of all factor of safety and be incapable of resist the danger of exceptional incident . death occur in connection with the differential pressure have they cause essentially in this unguarded state of the function of respiration . under tracheal insufflation , the function of respiration be surround with effective safeguard , at least as much as be normal respiration . dislodgment of the lung have no detrimental effect . after complete collapse of the lung , capillary adhesion within the alveolus and the small bronchus become a additional obstacle to the redistension and respiration . differential pressure hold this obstacle in abeyance . when the lung become collapse during a open pneumothorax , it should be keep in mind that the force which be require for redistension be greater than that which be sufficient to keep the lung continually distend . at the beginning of a redistension , therefore , a higher pressure should be employ for a short time . 
this investigation comprise a study of venous pulse , carotid , cardiographic , and heart sound record from twenty-one man with normal heart . the heart sound be record by the method of Einthoven . when correction be make for transmission , the first heart sound begin , on 0.131 of a second , 0.131 of a second before the c-wave of the venous pulse , and have a average duration of 0.128 of a second . the a second heart sound begin a few hundredth of a second before the v-wave and have a duration of 0.091 of a second . the third heart sound occur shortly before or be coincident with the beginning of the h-wave . the third heart sound have a average duration of about 0.03 of a second . considerable variation from the average position be note in individual case . this be especially true in the relation between the a second heart sound and the v-wave . measurement of the venous pulse and heart sound interval show that the a-c , c-v , and v-h venous pulse interval , the first to a second and the a second to third heart sound interval , and systole tend to remain fairly constant in length when cardiac cycle of different length be consider . the v-a , h-a , and x-a venous pulse interval , the third to first heart sound interval , and diastole tend to vary in length with variation in total length of the cycle . Records of the venous pulse and heart sound obtain from dog show a similar relation to that find in man . a earlier occurrence of    the first heart sound be a earlier occurrence of the first heart sound before the venous pulse . 
1 . 1 have be show that powdered hematin be exceedingly resistant to the metabolic action of tissue cell , and wherever inject the metabolic action of tissue cell will remain for week with but slight and slowly progress alteration . 2 . the change produce in hematin by tissue cell be identical with those change result from the oxidation of hematin by hydrogen peroxid , form a series of body of decrease color intensity , which manifest a iron reaction in inverse proportion to they color . 3 . these hemosideroid pigment be distinguish from true hemosiderin by the type of they a iron reaction in inverse proportion , by they solubility in dilute alkali , and by they destructive oxidation by hydrogen peroxid . 4 . crystalline hematin inject into the tissue be subject to the same change as powdered hematin . 3 . whereas powdered parahemosiderin be convert into hemosiderin by the tissue cell with comparative ease , powdered hematin show no such conversion within forty-seven day , and as the only demonstrable change produce in hematin by the tissue cell with comparative ease do not result in the formation of either hemosiderin or hematoidin , the assumption that hematin be the progenitor of these hemosideroid pigment seem unwarranted . 
1 . in a study of 129 case of appendicitis in child , we have find that in nineteen of child the appendix contain Oxyuris vermiculari or trichocephalus trichiura . 2 . much the commoner of the two parasite be much the commoner of the two parasite , occur seventeen time , while the trichocephalus be find only twice . 3 . in fifteen out of the nineteen of       child case , the two parasite be associate with a non-suppurative catarrhal type of appendicitis . if the four case of catarrhal oxyuri appendicitis of adult be also include , four may be say that 83 per cent . of the four case of catarrhal oxyuri appendicitis of adult of appendicitis associate with the two parasite have be of a non-suppurative catarrhal type of appendicitis . in the four remain case , the appendix be gangrenous . the cellular change note in the four case of catarrhal oxyuri appendicitis of adult have be distension of the crypt with mucus , hyperplasium of the lymph follicle , and in some case , the presence of a few leukocyte in the musculari and serosa . 4 . in thirteen of the nineteen of       child case -lrb- 70 per cent . -rrb- , there have be note , in addition to the cellular change note in   the four case of catarrhal oxyuri appendicitis of adult , certain lesion in the mucosa , unquestionably produce by the parasite . of the six case in which no specific lesion be demonstrate , the extensive gangrene in three of they might have obliterate no specific lesion have they be present . no specific lesion be not demonstrate in any one of the four adult case . 5 . much the commoner of the two parasite injure the mucosa by break through the lining epithelium and burrow into the lymph follicle for a greater or less distance . the mucosa invasion be usually accompany by extravasation of blood into the surround lymphoid tissue , and the mucosa invasion escape through the rupture mucosa . in some case , much the commoner of the two parasite produce hemorrhagic ulcer in the mucous membrane , the edge of which be undermine and the basis form by the submucosa , the edge of which be undermine and the basis form by the submucosa . a characteristic feature of the oxyuri lesion be a characteristic feature of the oxyuri lesion , except in those case where there be secondary bacterial infection . 6 . in some instance , much the commoner of the two parasite may become encapsulate in the mucosa with fibrous tissue , and the mucosa with fibrous tissue undergo hyaline degeneration . such a process constitute a heal oxyuri lesion . 7 . the trichocephalus attack   the mucous membrane , the edge of which be undermine and the basis form by the submucosa , the edge of which be undermine and the basis form by the submucosa of the appendix in a manner similar to   the mucous membrane , the edge of which be undermine and the basis form by the submucosa , the edge of which be undermine and the basis form by the submucosa describe for much the commoner of the two parasite , and there be the same absence of inflammation about the invade parasite . the trichocephalus , however , instead of invade a lymph follicle , show a tendency to burrow along just beneath the columnar epithelium . 8 . the conclusion to be draw from these fact be that oxyuri and trichocephalus , when oxyuri and trichocephalus occur in a diseased appendix , be , in most case , the exist cause of the pathological change find . 
pregnant dog be susceptible to chloroform administer shortly before delivery or during labor , and show the same degree of liver injury as normal dog , or even a somewhat greater one . a dangerous anesthetic may cause more or less hyaline necrosis in the border zone between the maternal and fetal part of the placenta that may lead to hemorrhage , placental separation , and premature delivery . a dangerous anesthetic cause no injury to the liver of the fetus nor to any other fetal organ , in spite of the fact that it can be demonstrate to be present in these tissue . these experiment raise objection to the use of chloroform in pregnant woman where a anesthetic must be continue for half a hour or longer . a dangerous anesthetic may be admissible for the few minute at the end of the delivery , but when operative measure be necessary , before or after delivery , a dangerous anesthetic be a dangerous anesthetic and surely capable of produce injury to the liver in the manner recognize in the case of normal person . objection may be raise to the application of conclusion derive from experiment on pregnant dog to human case ; but the similarity of the effect of chloroform in man and dog surely afford a sound basis of comparison . two fundamental fact would seem to be now establish : -lrb- 1 -rrb- normal human adult may be fatally poison -lrb- late chloroform poisoning -rrb- by chloroform anesthesia of one half to one hour 's duration . -lrb- 2 -rrb- normal and pregnant dog be equally susceptible to late chloroform poisoning , and may be fatally poison by a anesthesia of two hour ' duration . hence one may conclude that probably normal and pregnant human being be equally susceptible to chloroform poisoning , that chloroform anesthesia during any part of the pregnant period be capable of cause liver necrosis , and , consequently , that chloroform be a dangerous anesthetic . 
employ the liver necrosis as a index , we find that pup be immune to the poisonous action of chloroform anesthesia . this immunity or resistance to late chloroform poisoning be complete in the first week , very striking during the second and third week , and usually disappear during the fourth week of life . nest of blood-forming cell -lrb- the blood island -rrb- be numerous in the sinus of the liver during the first week and normally become progressively less numerous each week until the liver during   the first week be almost free from these cell at the end of the fourth week of life . it be consider possible that these leucocyte in the blood island protect the liver against the specific action of a known poison -lrb- chloroform -rrb- . the mechanism of this hypothetical protective action be not understand , but the mechanism of this hypothetical protective action may consist of a process of neutralization . perhaps this protective action against poison be a important part of the function of white blood cell and may bear a important relationship to the process of inflammation . 
1 . the living tissue of the chicken sarcoma , when implant in susceptible host , survive , proliferate , and thus give rise apparently to the whole of the new tumor . the histological finding about the graft do not suggest any other origin for the growth . 2 . in fowl with a natural or acquire resistance , a very striking series of the phenomenon take place about the graft or the established growth . they be referable to the presence of the living neoplastic cell and be essentially similar to those already describe in mammal . 3 . the lymphocyte have a association with the process of resistance in the fowl , similar to , but more marked than that observe in mammal . 4 . resistance of the host do not constitute for the chicken tumor a differential means whereby the extrinsic agent present in the growth can be observe to engender the growth . in general , it may be state that , when the new host be so unfavorable to the transplant sarcoma cell as to cause that observe in mammal death , the chicken tumor develop . 5 . the activity of the extrinsic agent present in  the growth be negligible as affect the interpretation of the phenomenon about graft of the avian sarcoma in resistant and susceptible host . that observe in mammal be referable to the presence of the transplant sarcoma cell . 6 . the appearance or non-appearance of a specific , support , and vascularize reaction in the host tissue can not be look upon as determine the fate of graft of the chicken sarcoma . the same seem to be true of mammalian neoplasm . 
fatal leprosy , with all fatal leprosy clinical and pathological manifestation in man , may be experimentally induce in the monkey -lrb- macacus rhesus -rrb- with a pure culture of the acid-fast bacillus cultivate by one of we -lrb- Duval -rrb- from a leprous lesion in man . to produce the disease experimentally , the disease seem necessary to give the animal repeat injection of large number of leprosy bacillus at give interval for a period of month . that the infection be more likely to follow where sensitization be first establish be definitely prove by the specific experiment that we have carry out upon a variety of laboratory animal . the first injection , we assume , sensitize the animal and may consist of either kill or viable lepra bacillus . the necessity of first sensitize the monkey -lrb- macacus rhesus -rrb- and then give repeat dose of viable organism over a long period might explain the relative infrequency of the disease in man ; at least , the necessity of first sensitize  the monkey -lrb- macacus rhesus -rrb- and then give repeat dose of viable organism over a long period offer a explanation of the fact that man rarely , if ever , contract fatal leprosy , although intimately associate for a indefinite period with those afflict with the disease . the leprous lesion in the monkey -lrb- macacus rhesus -rrb- be histologically indistinguishable from those in man and do not essentially resemble the specific lesion of tuberculosis , blastomycosis , or the lesion experimentally produce with saprophytic acid-fast species , since    a constant and characteristic feature for the experimental as well as the human lesion be a constant and characteristic feature for the experimental as well as the human lesion -lrb- figure 17 , 18 , and 19 -rrb- . the etiological factor in  fatal leprosy prove conclusively that the acid-fast bacillus cultivate by one of we -lrb- Duval -rrb- from the human lesion be the Hansen the acid-fast bacillus and not some extraneous saprophyte , and that the etiological factor in  fatal leprosy be the etiological factor in fatal leprosy . in we experience , we experience have be extremely difficult to produce , in the lower animal , more than a transient localized lesion with human leprous material rich in the specific bacillus , unless the animal be first sensitize , when lesion histologically identical with those produce by pure culture be easily induce . therefore , it be natural to expect that culture of bacillus leproe which be many generation remove from the parent stem be less likely to infect , unless give in larger dose on the ground of loss in virulence . when experimental leprous lesion occur in the internal organ , many generation remove from the parent stem be less likely to infect be more often find in the liver and spleen , while experimental leprous lesion occasionally produce in the lower animal with some of the saprophyte species , such as the bacillus of timothy hay , Moeller 's grass the specific bacillus , etc. , rarely , if ever , occur in these organ -lrb- abbott and Gildersleeve -rrb- . these author do not find lesion in the liver and spleen in a single instance after inoculate forty-five rabbit intravenously with large dose of the `` confusing group . '' furthermore , a well know fact and the appearance and arrangement of these bacillus in the lesion in no way resemble experimental leprosy -lrb- Hölscher -rrb- . a well know fact be a well know fact that a give culture be not the Hansen the acid-fast bacillus because the individual organism differ in size and shape from those in the tissue , since a well know fact be a well know fact that marked variation in morphology be common for many bacterial species under natural and artificial condition . one of we -lrb- couret -rrb- have already point out that there be a wide variation in morphology for bacillus leproe under different environment . the experimental work serve not only to emphasize a well know fact , but be proof that a transformation from the slender beaded rod of the tissue to solidly stain diplococcoid form of culture do occur for bacillus leproe ; and , conversely , that the coccoid form of culture may again assume the slender beaded appearance by passage through warm-blooded animal . 
those condition of the new-born characterize by a hemorrhagic tendency , icterus , and fatty change , be probably all syndrome which may occur as the result of a number of toxic agent . all of they , however , have be produce , in these experiment , by the action of a single experimental agent . thus , a picture indistinguishable from that call Buhl 's disease have be obtain by the use of chloroform , as have also the picture know as Winckel 's disease , Winckel 's disease , etc. . Chloroform be not hold to be the only substance that have this power . Chloroform stand rather as one member of a group of agent , the effect of which in general and in individual organ be similar to those cause by lack of oxygen . the essential feature of those condition of the new-born characterize by a hemorrhagic tendency , icterus , and fatty change have also be produce by direct asphyxiation of the fetus . the suggestion be therefore make that underlie all these symptom and pathological complex , there be a deficiency of oxidation , general , local , or selective , thus bring this group of disease into the general category of acute yellow atrophy of the liver , eclampsium , pernicious vomit , cyclic vomiting , phosphorus poisoning , etc. . in human being , chloroform and asphyxia must , in many instance , be chloroform and asphyxia . there remain , however , other case in which different factor be to be seek . 
1 . in most case of chronic or subacute bacterial endocarditis due to the endocarditis coccus -lrb- streptococcus viridan -rrb- , there exist a distinctive pathological lesion in some of the glomerulus due to bacterial embolus . 2 . the salient feature of the pathological picture be first , the involvement of one or more loop of a variable number of glomerulus ; secondly , the absence of any visible disease in the uninvolved glomerulus and in the uninvolved portion of affect glomerulus ; and thirdly , the association in most of the bacterial case of all the various stage of the glomerular process often see in a single microscopical section . 3 . a distinctive pathological lesion in some of the glomerulus do not occur in case of acute endocarditis , and up to the present time the present time have be absent in most case of chronic or subacute bacterial endocarditis due to the endocarditis coccus -lrb- streptococcus viridan -rrb- due to organism other than the endocarditis coccus . 4 . in a group of case have vegetation that be typical of those in the active stage of subacute endocarditis -lrb- except that they be free from bacterium and healing or heal -rrb- , the heal stage of this distinctive glomerular lesion be present , although a group of case be less extensive than in the active bacterial case . 5 . the active bacterial case , therefore , be most probably    the active bacterial case . 6 . during the active bacterial stage of the disease , if the glomerular lesion be not too numerous , the only symptom produce will be a almost constant hematurium , usually demonstrable only microscopically . if the glomerular lesion be very numerous , symptom resemble those of subacute hemorrhagic nephritis may occur and may even cause a fatal issue . if the glomerular lesion be very numerous but not sufficient to cause death , and the cardiac lesion should go on to healing , a contract kidney , a contract kidney , may subsequently ensue and produce the typical symptom and death . in such a case , the finding of the heal or healing lesion of subacute bacterial endocarditis will be accidental . 
in the first experiment , a segment of popliteal artery , extirpate from the leg of a young man and preserve for twenty-four day in cold storage , be transplant upon the abdominal aorta of a small bitch . the animal live in excellent health for two year , become pregnant several time , and finally die during labor . the abdominal aorta of a small bitch be normal , but the human arterial segment be slightly dilate , and the human arterial segment wall be compose of connective tissue only . in the second experiment , a segment of the dog jugular vein , preserve for twenty-four hour in cold storage , be transplant upon the thoracic aorta of a fox terrier . in spite of slight lesion of the cord due to interruption of the aortic circulation during the operation , the animal remain in excellent health . after  two year , the dog die of a epidemic disease . the descend aorta be normal . the transplant segment have about the same caliber as that of the descend aorta , but the transplant segment its wall be compose of connective tissue , with no evidence of muscular or elastic tissue . in these two experiment , the wall of the transplant segment contain neither muscle nor elastic tissue fiber and be not thicker than those of popliteal artery . nevertheless , those of  popliteal artery be able to withstand the pressure of the blood without undergo any marked dilatation . if death due to accident have not bring two these two experiment to a end , it be probable that the transplant segment would have successfully resist the pressure of the blood for a much longer time . as death due to accident be , the result show that , in one experiment after   and in the other after   , the segment transplant upon the abdominal and thoracic aorta be still efficient . 
1 . bone marrow of guinea pig grow better in autogenic than in homogenic serum . 2 . guinea pig grow more extensively and rapidly in unheated than in heated autogenic and homogenic serum -lrb- 56 degree c. for half a hour -rrb- . 3 . in different heterogenic serum , there be difference in the growth of the tissue . in none of the serum examine , be the growth of the tissue so extensive as in homogenic and autogenic serum . 4 . heated heterogenic serum be a better culture medium and show more extensive tissue growth than normal unheated heterogenic serum . 
1 . Adrenalin cause a marked constriction of the human coronary artery , although Adrenalin undoubtedly produce a relaxation in some mammal ; e. g. , calf , sheep , pig , etc. 2 . the human coronary artery be probably provide with sympathetic vasoconstrictor . 3 . if human blood-vessel be obtain in a warm condition within a few hour after death , they be often suitable for biological and pharmacological study . 
as a result of the experimental work here record , there can be no doubt of the fact that the rate of inflow in shock be faster than normally , and in my experiment 36 per cent be 36 per cent . it be conclude , therefore , that decrease vasomotor tone be decrease vasomotor tone . 
the most marked chemical change in a disintegrate spleen be notice during the period when karyorrhexi and karyolysis be karyorrhexi and karyolysis . when pyknosis alone be prominent almost all of the several constituent be in the coagulable or precipitable fraction , just as almost all of the several constituent be in the original normal tissue . after karyolysis be practically complete the coagulable and precipitable element of the original normal tissue still gradually decrease in amount , but the rate be far below the original normal tissue occur during karyorrhexi and karyolysis . moreover , even when microscopical nuclear disintegration be practically at a end , the chemical process of disintegration be still go on , but very slowly . finally , when nuclear structure can no longer be see in a disintegrate spleen , about 72 per cent . of the nuclein nitrogen , about 50 per cent . of the original insoluble phosphorus , and 70 per cent . of the original insoluble nitrogen , be still in the insoluble form -lrb- precipitable and coagulable by alcohol -rrb- , while about two third of the phosphatid phosphorus remain in complex organic combination . 
in two case of infantilism there be poor absorption from the intestine of nitrogen , sulphur , phosphorus , calcium , and magnesium . the excretion of these element in the urine be low . the excretion of calcium in the urine be so small as to be negligible . the excretion of calcium into the intestine of nitrogen , sulphur , phosphorus , calcium , and magnesium be increase . the complete balance experiment show that while other element be retain , calcium be lose . 
a strain of spirochoeta refringen have be obtain in pure culture , and a strain of spirochoeta refringen morphological and cultural characteristic have be study . a strain of spirochoeta refringen possess no pathogenicity for rabbit or monkey . a strain of spirochoeta refringen probably belong to the genus treponema , but a strain of spirochoeta refringen be easily differentiate from . a strain of spirochoeta refringen relation to spirochoeta balanitidi and spirochoeta buccali be still undetermined . 
the corpuscle be rapid , a considerable amount be absorb in as short a period as fifteen seconds . in the sensitization of the corpuscle , the amount of amboceptor absorb by the different corpuscle be not uniform , the inequality depend on the time take in obtain a even distribution of the corpuscle through the diluted immune serum . a considerable amount be absorb in as short a period as fifteen seconds be apparently influence by the concentration of the corpuscle , be more rapid with a 5 per cent . than with a 2 per cent . suspension , and thus the stronger concentration be more susceptible to inequality of sensitization from variation in the method of activation . in experimental work , the stronger concentration be of importance to obtain as equal a sensitization as possible . it be essential that in comparative titration the same method of activation be employ in the several titration , and where possible it be advisable that all the cell use be sensitize together in bulk . the result obtain in titrate hemolytic serum and complement depend to a considerable extent upon the evenness of the sensitization of the corpuscle . 
the experiment here describe indicate that the peptone fraction can alter the different blood element in such a manner as to affect they immunological reaction . this power be not possess by all the peptone equally , either qualitatively or quantitatively . if we regard the phenomenon of hemolysis by immune serum in the light of a biochemical process , depend upon property inherent in certain constituent of the serum and the red blood cell , the experiment describe reveal a number of fact concern the immunochemical action of albumose and peptone . these substance , which depend for certain constituent of the serum and the red blood cell separation and identification upon purely physical means , show difference in certain constituent of the serum and the red blood cell behavior toward the element concern in the production of hemolysis . Inagaki -lrb- 7 -rrb- have show that albumose and peptone can combine with nucleohiston . it be not improbable , therefore , that chemical as well as physicochemical be chemical as well as physicochemical in character . further study be necessary to determine whether the reaction elicit can aid we in the differentiation of the peptone body , for which at present we possess but few test . the result , however , be suggestive , and may aid in recognize the presence of these substance in the serum and the red blood cell . 
Salvarsan in capsule and in solution in dose vary from 0.1 to 0.6 of a gram be administer by mouth to the seven , however patient suffer from syphilis . five patient be give full dose of 0.1 to 0.6 of a gram of a gram . one patient -lrb- case 3 -rrb- receive in the aggregate within four week 2.4 gram without loss of weight or any disturbing effect . a ulcerating gumma of the knee be practically heal after a period of five week . the only patient of   the seven , however , however , however , in whom notable improvement in the cutaneous manifestation follow the administration of the drug be the only patient of  the seven , however , however , however , in whom notable improvement in the cutaneous manifestation follow the administration of the drug . this ulceration would probably have heal as soon , or possibly sooner , under the influence of mercury and the iodid . from the above observation , this ulceration would appear that salvarsan administer by mouth up to the full dose of a gram , have a perceptible though feeble therapeutic effect on cutaneous syphilitic manifestation . we should naturally expect the influence of any drug to be more evident in the case of a gumma , in which the spirochaete be only sparsely present , than in the secondary syphilide in which the spirochaete be present in enormous number . cutaneous gumma be readily heal at time by very small dose of mercury and the iodid . it be interesting to note that the administration of the full dose of the drug by mouth do not appear to give rise to symptom of systemic arsenical poisoning , unless the vomiting and diarrhea be regard as such . after some of the full dose administration , there be neither vomit nor diarrhea . as salvarsan contain 34 per cent . of arsenic , five patient receive the equivalent of five grain of arsenic . in case 3 , in the course of four week 2.4 gram the only patient of   the seven , however , however , however , in whom notable improvement in the cutaneous manifestation follow the administration of the drug take by mouth the equivalent of over twelve grain of arsenic , without vomit or have diarrhea , and with no loss of weight or disturbance of health . the urine of the only patient of   the seven , however , however , however , in whom notable improvement in the cutaneous manifestation follow the administration of the drug be entirely normal . the urine of  the only patient of   the seven , however , however , however , in whom notable improvement in the cutaneous manifestation follow the administration of the drug would seem , therefore , that salvarsan be not convert in the gastro-intestinal tract into a organotropic arsenical compound , and it be possible that the urine of  the only patient of   the seven , however , however , however , in whom notable improvement in the cutaneous manifestation follow the administration of the drug may remain practically unchanged . 
1 . foreign body giant cell may be produce in vitro by the addition of foreign object such as lycopodium spore and cotton fiber to culture of chick embryo spleen . 2 . foreign body giant cell be form by the fusion of large mononuclear wander cell , probably endothelial cell and pulp cell . connective tissue cell do not take part in they formation . 3 . the large giant cell sometimes see spread out over the cover-glass in chick embryo spleen be probably the large giant cell sometimes see spread out over the cover-glass in     chick embryo spleen . 
in two series of experiment make at the end of 1911 and at the beginning of 1912 , new technique be develop with the view of investigate the problem of prolong indefinitely the life of the tissue . new technique be far from perfect and will doubtless be modify in the future . but they have already permit the establishment of new fact . fragment of connective tissue have be keep in vitro in a condition of active life for more than two month . as a few culture be now eighty-five day old and be grow very actively , it be probable that , if no accident occur , the life of a few culture will continue for a long time . in some case the rate of growth of the tissue increase in direct ratio to the age of the culture . fragment of heart pulsate rhythmically at the beginning of the third month of the life of  a few culture in vitro . new fact show that experiment make with these or with more perfect technique and follow over long period of a long time may lead to the solution of the problem of permanent life of the tissue in vitro , and give important information on the character acquire by tissue liberate from the control of  the tissue from which these be derive . 
the writer believe that the experiment above record HAVE demonstrate the follow point : 1 . as have be previously show by other worker , complement be fix by the precipitate form in the reaction between unformed proteid and HAVE homologous antiserum , and it be the precipitate only which fix , the supernatant fluid be devoid of fix power except to a slight degree in tube very rich in antigen . this latter fixation be probably due to a redissolving of the precipitin-precipitinogen complex which , as gay have show , do not lose this latter fixation fix power on resolution . the fixation of complement by mixture in which antigen be so slight in amount that the precipitate form in the reaction between unformed proteid and HAVE homologous antiserum be form may be explain by analogy with colloidal reaction in which combination of colloid take place without precipitation unless definite quantitative relation be maintain . 2 . in contrast to the result above describe , precipitate mixture of bacterial antigen and antiserum show the fixation of complement by mixture in which antigen be so slight in amount that  the precipitate form in the reaction between unformed proteid and HAVE homologous antiserum be form both by the precipitate form in the reaction between unformed proteid and HAVE homologous antiserum and by the supernatant fluid . 3 . the complement fixation by the supernatant fluid of such bacterial precipitin reaction , with the precipitate form in the reaction between unformed proteid and HAVE homologous antiserum remove , be , in the presence of wash bacterium , equal to that exert by the same amount of the original serum . the complement fixation of the precipitate , here , as in serum-antiserum test , be proportionate to the bulk of the precipitate form in the reaction between unformed proteid and HAVE homologous antiserum . 4 . the precipitin body be not remove from a bacterial antiserum by treatment with washed whole bacterium , whereas the cell sensitizer or amboceptor be remove by such treatment . the writer believe that the work record above justify Gengou 's conclusion that a albuminolytic sensitizer be form in response to immunization with unformed proteid . a albuminolytic sensitizer the cell sensitizer or amboceptor , be , however , distinct and independent of a albuminolytic sensitizer that react specifically with either bacterial or other cell . a albuminolytic sensitizer would appear that immunization with unformed proteid call forth only the formation of these albuminolysin , while immunization with other cell , in we case the typhoid bacillus , call forth both the cytolytic and the albuminolytic sensitizer . the albuminolytic sensitizer be not carry down mechanically with the precipitate in such bacterial precipitin reaction . we see no reason for not consider the albuminolytic sensitizer identical with the precipitin the albuminolytic sensitizer , the precipitin the albuminolytic sensitizer and , as in other colloidal reaction , lead to precipitation when definite quantitative relation be observe . the undiminished precipitate value of a bacterial antiserum after considerable amount of bacterial amboceptor have be absorb out of no reason , would point against the identification of agglutinin with the precipitin the albuminolytic sensitizer . however , this question must be subject to further study . it be thus clear that only the cytolytic sensitizer can enter into combination with the wash bacterial cell , while it be probable that both cytolytic and albuminolytic sensitizer may combine with the dissolve ingredient of a bacterial filtrate . whether or not agglutinin with the precipitin the albuminolytic sensitizer combine with the same constituent of such a antigen can not be decide by the experiment . 
the paroxysm of hematin intoxication in the rabbit undoubtedly present many feature of striking similarity to the paroxysm of human malaria ; still one must hesitate to apply such result unreservedly in a attempt to identify the causative agent of the malarial paroxysm . when , in addition to the character of the paroxysm of hematin intoxication in the rabbit , we consider the sequence of event in the two instance , the analogy become so close that addition to the character of  the paroxysm of hematin intoxication in the rabbit seem impossible to regard the matter as a mere coincidence . the injection of hematin , especially in fractional dose , be in a measure comparable to the liberation of hematin into the human circulation by the malarial parasite . in these experiment , see pdf for structure both solution and finely divide suspension of hematin have be find equally effective in elicit the phenomenon of the paroxysm of hematin intoxication in the rabbit , and while it seem possible that a portion of the malarial pigment might be dissolve in the alkaline human serum , such a assumption be probably not essential . it might be object that the toxic action of foreign hematin thus inject into the circulation would probably be greater than that of hematin derive from a animal 's own blood , but as far as I have be able to determine , this objection do not seem valid , as rabbit hematin , dog hematin , and ox hematin produce in the rabbit effect that be alike in both character and degree . the dose of hematin remain as the one factor to which it be possible to attach some degree of uncertainty , but even here the author feel that the range of experimental condition have be keep within the bound of legitimate analogy with condition exist in the human subject of malarial infection . finally , the most conservative estimate of the value of such experiment point strongly to the fact that we have at least a potentially toxic substance in the pigment hematin as liberate by the malarial parasite into the circulation of the human host . there be also abundant evidence to show that the toxic action of foreign hematin be not confine to the paroxysmal phenomenon of malaria , but that other feature of the disease may find that of hematin derive from a animal 's own blood explanation in the action of the malarial pigment . for the present , however , the present seem advisable to confine the discussion to this one phase of the question . 
it be generally accept that complement may be split into a mid-piece and a end-piece . a mid-piece be think to be in the globulin fraction , and the end-piece in the albumin fraction . the restoration of complement activity by put together the albumin and globulin fraction do not prove , however , that each fraction contain a part of the complement , for the albumin fraction can be reactivate in the absence of the globulin fraction . complement-splitting as bring about by hydrochloric acid , carbon dioxid , and dialysis , be really a inactivation of the whole complement by certain acid or alkali , either add in the free state to the serum , or liberate as a result of the dissociation of certain electrolyte . that the whole complement by certain acid or alkali , and not a part only , be present in the albumin fraction of the serum can be demonstrate by the removal of the inhibitory action of the acid or alkali . this can be effect by the addition , not only of alkali or acid , but also of any amphoteric substance . when hydrochloric acid , carbon dioxid , or dialysis be employ to produce the phenomenon know as complement-splitting as bring about by hydrochloric acid , carbon dioxid , and dialysis , the complement be merely inactivate , not split . 
it have be show by these experiment that after the removal of one superior cervical ganglion of a rabbit , 1/50 of a cubic centimeter of a 1:1,000 adrenalin solution -lrb- 0.02 of a milligram of adrenalin -rrb- per kilo of body weight inject intravenously , be practically the minimum amount that will produce in nearly all case a perceptible dilatation of the pupil . in one out of eight animal this dose fail to give a definite effect , while in two other a definite effect be slight . six experiment with injection of body weight give the follow average : a maximum dilatation of 1.62 millimeter , which show the first sign of decrease in four minute and have disappear entirely in ten minute after the injection . six experiment with 1/30 of a cubic centimeter per kilo give the follow average : a maximum dilatation of 2.25 millimeter , which begin to disappear in eight minute and have entirely disappear in twenty-eight minute . for thirteen experiment with 1/20 of a cubic centimeter of      body weight the follow average : a maximum dilatation of 2.25 millimeter , which begin to disappear in eight minute and have entirely disappear in twenty-eight minute be : the maximum pupil dilatation . with 1/10 of a cubic centimeter of adrenalin per kilo -lrb- eight experiment -rrb- the follow average : a maximum dilatation of 2.25 millimeter , which begin to disappear in eight minute and have entirely disappear in twenty-eight minute be : a maximum dilatation of 3.87 millimeter , a begin recovery in ten minute , with complete recovery of the pupil in forty-five minute . finally , eleven experiment with 2/10 of a cubic centimeter of        body weight give average as follow : a maximum dilatation of 4.38 millimeter , a maximum dilatation of 4.38 millimeter from dilatation in twenty minute , with complete recovery only after one hundred minute or more . the time between the injection and the appearance of a maximum dilatation of 3.87 millimeter , a begin recovery in  ten minute , with complete recovery of the pupil in forty-five minute vary somewhat accord to the dose of adrenalin . in the series of          body weight the average for this interval be one minute ; in the series with 1/30 of a cubic centimeter per kilo , 1/20 of a cubic centimeter of        body weight , and 1/10 of a cubic centimeter of adrenalin per kilo -lrb- eight experiment -rrb- of a cubic centimeter the average length of this interval be about three minute , while a cubic centimeter give we a average for this interval of six and a half minute , with individual instance in which a maximum dilatation of 3.87 millimeter , a begin recovery in  ten minute , with complete recovery of the pupil in forty-five minute be see only after fourteen , seventeen , and twenty-two minute after the injection . in those animal in which the maximum pupil dilatation be especially delay , there be almost always more or less alarming symptom of general prostration for a short time after the injection , and a maximum dilatation of 3.87 millimeter , a begin recovery in  ten minute , with complete recovery of the pupil in forty-five minute appear as more or less alarming symptom of general prostration for a short time after  the injection gradually disappear . in other word , with a increase in the size of the dose of adrenalin , there be a gradual increase in the following : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the time between the injection and the appearance of a maximum dilatation of 3.87 millimeter , a begin recovery in  ten minute , with complete recovery of the pupil in forty-five minute ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- the amount of dilatation produce ; -lrb- 3 -rrb- the interval between the injection and the beginning of                  the maximum pupil dilatation ; and -lrb- 4 -rrb- in the total time between the injection and the return of the pupil to a increase in the size of    the dose of adrenalin normal size . after one superior cervical ganglion of a rabbit a certain time must elapse before the increase in the sensitiveness develop . during the first ten to fifteen hour there be practically the increase in the sensitiveness . after eighteen hour a moderate effect can be obtain which rapidly increase so that by twenty to twenty-four hour after one superior cervical ganglion of a rabbit any give dose of adrenalin produce practically as great a dilatation as twenty will give at any later time . six experiment with injection of            body weight teach we that , on account of the individual variation in the degree of dilatation produce by a give dose of adrenin , we may not determine with exactness from any give degree of dilatation of the pupil the quantity of adrenin inject into the blood stream , and that we can not state with absolute exactness either the smallest dose that will constantly cause a dilatation , or mention the exact amount of adrenin which will in no case cause a dilatation of the pupil the quantity of adrenin inject into the blood stream . however , the result permit the gener 
1 . the bactericidal agent extract from horse leucocyte be apparently precipitated quantitatively by full saturation with ammonium sulphate . 2 . the bactericidal agent extract from horse leucocyte be apparently precipitate by absolute alcohol , and be not render insoluble by a short contact with alcohol . the bactericidal agent extract from horse leucocyte resemble in this feature certain enzyme which can be isolate and purify by alcoholic precipitation . 
1 . a hitherto undescribed spiral organism have be isolate in pure culture from a case of mild phagedenic ulcer on the external genitalium of a woman . for a hitherto undescribed spiral organism the name spirochoeta phagedeni be propose . 2 . the name spirochoeta phagedeni be a strict anaerobe and grow in the presence of fresh tissue in ascitic agar . the name spirochoeta phagedeni produce no apparent change in the media , but a somewhat offensive odor develop in the culture tube . 3 . the name spirochoeta phagedeni incite a slight inflammatory reaction in the skin of a Macacus rhesus monkey and in the skin and testicle of rabbit . 4 . 4 etiological relation to the phagedenic lesion on the external genitalium of a woman have not yet be determine . 
this work prove that the proteolytic action of the leucocyte be not the proteolytic action of leucocyte by one ferment . there be present the two protease , one act in a alkaline medium and the other in a acid medium . this confirm Opie 's work . in the leucocyte there be find in addition a ereptic ferment which be capable of act in a acid or alkaline medium . since the proteolytic action of leucocyte be lose by heat to 70 degree c. , and by dry and keep the leucocyte , the proteolytic action of leucocyte probably represent a ferment which act on the digestion product of the two protease . analogy with other ferment in the body confirm this opinion . 
from a study of the accompany tracing we MAY CONCLUDE that : 1 . the delicate mechanism of the micrograph register the movement in the heart and blood-vessel more accurately than do the polygraph . 2 . the inertia of the polygraph lever and diaphragm distort the trace . the difference between the result obtain with the two instrument be show by the record make simultaneously with the micrograph and the polygraph . 3 . the micrograph be particularly useful for record heart sound . some record illustrate this be show . we be direct especial attention to this and will report the result obtain with the two instrument in a subsequent paper . 4 . while the micrograph will not supersede the polygraph or electrocardiograph , we feel that the micrograph have distinct possibility as a clinical instrument . 
in four of the seven case the ventricle remain active from one and a half to eighteen minute after the electrocardiogram fail to show evidence of auricular activity . in two case the auricle outlast the ventricle and in one case only do the auricle and ventricle stop apparently at the same time . complete dissociation occur three time . some delay in the conduction time be see in five of the seven case . in two case the auricle cease to beat before evidence of impaired conduction appear . there be always marked slowing ; the slowest independent ventricular rate vary from 13.6 to 47.0 . the slowest rate at which the auricle beat regularly vary from 20 to 65 per minute . there be never evidence of auricular fibrillation , although in two case the electrocardiogram give fairly conclusive evidence that ventricular fibrillation occur . the ventricle reëstablished a regular rhythm after a short period of ventricular fibrillation in one case , while in the other but one ventricular contraction occur after the appearance of fibrillation . characteristic change in the ventricular complex of the electrocardiogram occur in all the record . the electrocardiogram consist of a gradual fusion of the r - and t-wave , form , when a gradual fusion of the r - and t-wave be complete , a large round or peak wave . in some case the identity of the two wave be not entirely lose . in spite of the marked change in shape of the ventricular complex , there be often but little change in the electrocardiogram duration . in some case the ventricular systole be shorten at the end , while in other the ventricular systole be prolong . the change in the form of the ventricular electrical complex indicate that the course of the stimulus and the manner of the contraction of the muscle be abnormal . the fact that the r-wave become gradually prolonged suggest that the conduction of the stimulus through the ventricular wall become delay as the heart die . the fact that after death there be a continuation of cardiac muscular activity sufficient to cause a difference in electrical potential between the two side of the body do not necessarily mean that a ventricular systole in the sense of muscular shorten take place . the fact that after death there be a continuation of cardiac muscular activity sufficient to cause a difference in electrical potential between the two side of the body have be observe experimentally that well define electrical complex may be cause by cardiac activity which can not be see or record graphically . as the duration of the ventricular complex characteristic of the die heart usually do not differ markedly from the duration of the ventricular complex characteristic of the die heart before clinical death , it seem probable that the entire musculature of the ventricle participate in the contraction of the muscle ; at least a marked change in duration , or at least a marked change in duration , would be expect if only a part of the ventricular musculature participate in the activity which produce the ventricular electrical complex . 
thus , we conclusion harmonize with those of Brugsch and Schittenhelm in so far as those of Brugsch and Schittenhelm be concern with the nuclein metabolism . those of Brugsch and Schittenhelm add , however , the observation that the elimination of nitrogenous substance of protein origin have a protracted character , and that the oxidation of as simple a substance as asparagin proceeds at a subnormal rate . the very imperfect elimination of ingest urea when the patient be place on a diet contain only six gram of nitrogen per day , and a much more complete elimination when the diet contain thirteen gram of nitrogen be the very imperfect elimination of ingest urea when  the very imperfect elimination of ingest urea when the patient be place on a diet contain only six gram of nitrogen per day , and a much more complete elimination when the diet contain thirteen gram of nitrogen be place on a diet contain only six gram of nitrogen per day , and a much more complete elimination when a diet contain only six gram of nitrogen per day contain thirteen gram of nitrogen . 
in this series of twenty-four person inoculate with antityphoid vaccine , the immune body in the blood reach twenty-four person inoculate with antityphoid vaccine height within two month after the first inoculation , or one month after the third , then fall rapidly within the next two month . only nineteen of the case could be follow longer , and eight of these be negative for bactericidin within ten month after inoculation , and fifteen be negative after thirteen month . only one serum react in a dilution of 1 to 1,200 at the end of thirteen month . the addition of lecithin to the vaccine do not influence the local reaction after inoculation , nor do the addition of lecithin to the vaccine appreciably affect the formation of the immune body in the blood to the typhoid bacillus . 
in rabbit and cat in which a hemorrhagic anemia have be produce , the hemoglobin be regenerate much more slowly than the red corpuscle , but the index , relative to the red corpuscle , never rise above one . the resistance of the red corpuscle be not increase . in the erythrocyte , the nucleus of the erythroblast seem to lose   the erythrocyte chromatin , but be apparently not extrude . punctate basophilia of the erythrocyte be a common feature and seem to result from a diffusion of nuclear chromatin through the cell . extramedullary myeloid metaplasium be generally slight , but in moderately severe and long continued anemia from bleed punctate basophilia of the erythrocyte may be very extensive . Lipemia usually occur when the blood be reduce below a certain limit . the greater part of the fat in the serum can be extract with ether and be stain by osmic acid . extensive fatty infiltration of the organ may occur and also widespread necrosis in the central part of the liver lobule . pigmentation of the internal organ be usually only slight , but may be considerable , particularly in the spleen . although there be minor difference , all the essential feature of anemia produce by toxin can be reproduce by hemorrhage . 
extract of the kidney of normal rabbit prepare one , two , three , and four day after the intravenous injection of egg-albumin and horse serum have the power to sensitize guinea pig to a second injection of these protein . the sensitization by first and second day extract be constant and intense , that by the third day only occasional be less marked and sometimes be not evident , and that by the fourth day only occasional be only occasional , and when present be always weak . comparative study of the power of the blood , liver , and kidney to sensitize , indicate that the sensitization by first and second day extract depend on the content of foreign protein in the circulate blood and not upon the sensitization by first and second day extract accumulation or fixation in the tissue of a organ . this opinion be support by other experiment in which the sensitize power of the blood , liver , and kidney to sensitize and of first and second day extract of unwashed kidney be compare with the sensitize power of extract of wash kidney . the weak sensitize power of wash kidney extract be take as evidence that foreign protein of the kind use be not hold in the tissue of wash kidney , and if these result may be apply to nephrotoxic protein , it follow that nephritis be not due to selective and persist fixation of a protein by the renal cell , but be due to the action of such protein merely during the process of fixation of a protein elimination . in experimental acute nephritis of the type due to uranium nitrate , the power of sensitization to egg-albumin be prolong for twenty-four hour , and in the chrornate type for forty-eight hour , thus indicate that in nephritis , of the acute type at least , the elimination of a foreign protein be delay . attempt to study by the same method the elimination of vegetable and bacterial protein have fail . 
this investigation bring out three point . 1 . during the first three or four week after splenectomy hemoglobinurium due to hemolytic serum be not follow by jaundice . 2 . one month and more after splenectomy the red cell have a increase resistance to hemolysis . 3 . three and a half month after splenectomy and even later , jaundice occasionally occur spontaneously . attempt to explain these three phenomenon have be base on the follow possibility : -lrb- 1 -rrb- that some function of the spleen be essential for the degradation of hemoglobin or for the elaboration of the spleen derivative ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- that there be some interrelation between the spleen and the blood-forming organ or between the spleen and the blood-disintegrating mechanism , or perhaps both interrelation exist ; -lrb- 3 -rrb- that there be a disturbance of the hemolyzing or bile-forming function of the liver dependent on the blood change follow splenectomy . this multiplicity of problem and likewise of possible explanation have render the presentation of the explanatory work in one communication extremely difficult . in the interest of clearness , therefore , the various phase be deal with in separate papers . 
the result of this study may be state as follow . 1 . rapid injection of more than 0.06 of a gram per kilo of hemoglobin intravenously into a normal animal be follow by the appearance of hemoglobin in the urine -lrb- pelvis of kidney -rrb- within eight to ten minute . 2 . after rapid injection of more than 0.012 of a gram per kilo per minute of hemoglobin , 16 to 36 per cent . of the total amount , if this equal 0.25 of a gram per kilo , be eliminate in the urine -lrb- pelvis of kidney -rrb- within eight to ten minute and be accompany by cholurium . 3 . if the injection of not more than 0.35 of a gram per kilo be make slowly -lrb- less than 0.01 of a gram per kilo per minute -rrb- , only 2.33 to 9.5 per cent be only 2.33 to 9.5 per cent . of the total amount inject , and cholurium do not occur . 4 . approximately 0.06 of a gram of hemoglobin per kilo of body weight be approximately 0.06 of a gram of hemoglobin per kilo of body weight . when approximately 0.06 of a gram of hemoglobin per kilo of body weight be reach , hemoglobin appear in the urine -lrb- pelvis of kidney -rrb- within eight to ten minute . 5 . approximately 0.18 of a gram , be approximately 0.18 of a gram . when 0.22 or 0.23 of a gram be retain bile pigment appear in the urine -lrb- pelvis of kidney -rrb- within eight to ten minute . the threshold of the liver for jaundice in point of hemoglobin saturation lie , therefore , between 0.18 and 0.22 of a gram per body weight . with slow injection a greater amount may be retain without cholurium . 6 . the absence of the spleen do not alter greatly the percentage of hemoglobin eliminate by the kidney , nor do the absence of the spleen raise the threshold of the liver for jaundice in point of hemoglobin saturation . 7 . in the presence of jaundice , either hemolytic or obstructive , the amount of hemoglobin retain by splenectomized animal be slightly diminish and that eliminate by    approximately 0.06 of a gram of hemoglobin per kilo of body weight be correspondingly increase . upon these datum may be base the follow explanation of the mechanism by which free hemoglobin be remove from the blood serum . hemoglobin be not remove by the kidney until the kidney concentration in the blood serum reach a certain level -lrb- body weight -rrb- . this constitute        approximately 0.06 of a gram of hemoglobin per kilo of body weight and when this be reach hemoglobin appear in the urine -lrb- pelvis of kidney -rrb- within eight to ten minute . when the kidney concentration in the blood serum be lower , hemoglobinurium cease ; at the same time , however , the liver for jaundice in point of hemoglobin saturation , and possibly other tissue , take up hemoglobin as soon as mere trace be present in the blood serum and they continue this removal whether the renal threshold be exceed or not . the two process go on simultaneously , the rate of removal , when the renal threshold be exceed , be for    approximately 0.06 of a gram of hemoglobin per kilo of body weight 17 to 36 per cent. , and for  the liver for jaundice in point of hemoglobin saturation , and possibly other tissue 64 to 83 per cent , of the total amount introduce . the hemoglobin which be remove by the liver for jaundice in point of hemoglobin saturation be transform into bile pigment . if the amount reach the liver for jaundice in point of hemoglobin saturation be small and be receive slowly , the amount of bile form be not increase above the excretory capacity of the liver for jaundice in point of hemoglobin saturation , and the amount reach  the liver for jaundice in point of hemoglobin saturation be remove by the bile passage without the occurrence of cholurium . this be show in we experiment in which injection of hemoglobin be make more slowly than kilo per minute . on the other hand , if the hemoglobin which be remove by  the liver for jaundice in point of hemoglobin saturation be take up by the liver for jaundice in point of hemoglobin saturation rapidly and in large amount , the bile capillary be overtax and the bile can not be rapidly remove , but be reabsorb into            approximately 0.06 of a gram of hemoglobin per kilo of body weight , and cholurium develop . if this theory be correct we have a explanation of those instance of blood destruction in man characterize by jaundice , but not accompany by hemoglobinurium . in a slow , gradual destruction of the red blood cell , the liver for jaundice in point of hemoglobin saturation remove the hemoglobin which be remove by  the liver for jaundice in point of hemoglobin saturation from the blood serum so rapidly that the concentration of hemoglobin in the blood serum do not reach        approximately 0.06 of a gram of hemoglobin per kilo of body weight and hemoglobinurium , therefore , can not occur . the constant absorption of large amount of the hemoglobin which be remove by  the liver for jaundice in point of hemoglobin saturation and the increase in bile formation which result do , however , overtax the bile passage and jaundice occur . in the same way may be explain the continuance of jaundice after the disappearance of a 
when the auricle fibrillate , the following effect be observe . 1 . the arterial blood pressure may rise , fall , or remain stationary . usually the arterial blood pressure fall . if the arterial blood pressure fall , the arterial blood pressure generally rise again towards or to the initial pressure . 2 . the venous pressure change be the reverse of the arterial . 3 . the intestinal volume and the cardiac output change be in the same direction as those of arterial blood pressure . 4 . from these observation it may be conclude that the peripheral circulatory effect be purely passive . 5 . the volume of the heart decrease except in instance where there be reason to believe that the circulation be fail . all also the variation in blood pressure reaction which occur from time to time , and also the variation in blood pressure reaction which occur from time to time , be attributable to alteration in the rate of ventricular contraction . though perhaps less profound change , though perhaps less profound change , be see when the heart rate accelerate in like degree in response to regular induction shock . 
1 . there be a great difference between embryonic and adult tissue as far as they growth outside of the organism be concern . adult tissue grow only in plasma . embryonic tissue grow also very well in serum and serum plus agar . in Ringer 's solution and in Ringer 's Ringer 's solution plus agar they growth outside of the organism occur , whether embryonic or adult tissue be employ ; survival and emigration of cell be see to some extent . 2 . for the growth of connective tissue cell of chick embryo , unheated homogenic serum be a better culture medium than heated serum . the growth of epithelial cell be not thus influence . 3 . heated heterogenic serum be a better culture medium for growth of embryonic connective tissue cell than unheated . 4 . there be a inverse ratio between the hemolytic power of heterogenic serum and the extent of growth of embryonic connective tissue cell than unheated . a inverse ratio between the hemolytic power of heterogenic serum and the extent of     growth of embryonic connective tissue cell than unheated be not find in heterogenic plasma . 
the all important point reveal by the investigation be the all important point reveal by the investigation that a large proportion of bone and joint tuberculosis occur in child in Edinburgh owe Edinburgh origin to infection by the bovine bacillus . the bovine bacillus be introduce into the system practically by one route only , one route only , and cow 's milk be cow 's milk . it be not my intention to criticize in any way the existing condition of milk supply . my have furnish proof of what be actually occur and no one will deny that a remediable one be a remediable one . in those case in which the human bacillus be present , a considerable proportion show a definite history of pulmonary tuberculosis affect a co-resident , and every fact go to prove that a direct one from patient have be a direct one from patient to child . a complete distinction can be draw between human and bovine bacillus , and a complete distinction be a complete distinction . the subject be one which ought to be investigate in a series of different locality . it be possible that a factor in the explanation of the difference between the above result and those of other observer may be a factor in the explanation of the difference between the above result and those of other observer . 
mouse die several day after injection of pneumococcus , both living and dead , frequently show at autopsy large intrathoracic hemorrhage . the histological study of the thoracic organ indicate that there occur in each case a sharply circumscribe , acute degeneration of the vessel wall , usually the ascend aorta or one of the pulmonary artery . this degenerate portion be tear out by the pressure of the blood with almost complete disappearance of the vessel wall , lead to a gross hemorrhage . a similar change be occasionally find in the wall of the vein which contain cardiac instead of smooth muscle . we have find this lesion only in mouse which have be recently inoculate with pneumococcus . negative culture at autopsy , the lack of inflammatory reaction , and the occurrence of the condition after injection of pneumococcus , both living and dead suggest the cause to be a toxic degeneration of the vessel wall bring about by the poison of the inject organism . 
the four series of experiment describe above indicate clearly that tetanic stimulation of the sinus region of the auricle be of material assistance to massage in the resuscitation of the heart . the four series of experiment describe above cause the auricle to generate impulse , either rhythmical or irregular , to the four series of experiment describe above the ventricle , when susceptible , respond . when massage administer for brief period have fail to resuscitate the heart , the same period of massage combine with tetanic stimulation of the sinus have usually bring the circulation , that impulse generate in a auricle start by stimulation can at first manifest no effect upon  the ventricle back to normal . in some instance massage alone when continue over long brief period have be without effect , and to all appearance would have continue to be without effect , whereas at such a time massage combine with tetanic stimulation of the sinus have effect recovery . whether the stimulus cause the auricle to beat normally or to fibrillate seem to make no essential difference in the end result . not infrequently conductivity and irritability be lower to such a extent by the cessation of the circulation , that impulse generate in a auricle start by stimulation can at first manifest no effect upon  the ventricle , that impulse generate in a auricle start by stimulation can at first manifest no effect upon the ventricle . under such circumstance massage combine with tetanic stimulation of the sinus may cause the ventricle to beat with the auricle inherent slow rate . often then the force of the ventricular contraction be insufficient for the maintenance of a effective circulation . in such case , however , with the gradual improvement in the condition of the heart , the auricular impulse , as a rule , soon begin to reach the ventricle , with the end result that the latter immediately begin to beat more rapidly and effectively . the beneficial result of stimulation of the auricle , therefore , manifest the auricle relatively late , but none the less effectively . stimulation of  the auricle have be find that even after the heart have begin to beat , stimulation of the sinus region of the auricle may still be of some assistance , though in another direction . stimulation of  the auricle not infrequently happen that after the heart the blood pressure fail to rise above a certain low and insufficient level . in such case repeat tetanic stimulation of the sinus may accelerate the rise of the blood pressure and so hasten recovery -lrb- protocol of experiment 12 , series II , and text-figure 5 -rrb- . no attempt have be make to determine the mechanism of this effect . 
we draw the follow conclusion from we experiment on the antigenic property of chemically pure casein and some of chemically pure casein split product . casein and paranuclein have distinct antigenic property , particularly as show by some of chemically pure casein split product ability to sensitize guinea pig for subsequent anaphylactic intoxication by each other or by milk . this sensitize ability and a corresponding ability to intoxicate be indistinguishably equivalent , under the condition employ . on immunize rabbit by repeat injection of paranuclein or of casein , and subsequently test this sensitize ability and a corresponding ability to intoxicate serum for precipitin and fixation antibody , it be find that casein apparently produce this sensitize ability and a corresponding ability to intoxicate much more readily , give a antiserum that react -lrb- fixation -rrb- in very high dilution with casein -lrb- 0.000,000,1 of a 1 per cent . solution -rrb- , but much less strongly with paranuclein . only one of two antiparanuclein serum show the presence of antibody to paranuclein by the delicate fixation reaction , and that in relatively small amount . the two antibody to casein and to paranuclein be , in the case of casein quantitatively , and in the case of casein of paranuclein absolutely specific . a solution of the product of complete peptic digestion of casein fail to sensitize to paranuclein and give -lrb- fixation -rrb- in very high dilution reaction with a anticasein or antiparanuclein serum . a solution of the product of complete peptic digestion of casein intoxicate animal sensitize to paranuclein but no more markedly than a solution of the product of complete peptic digestion of casein do normal animal . a solution of the product of complete peptic digestion of casein also fail to show specific intoxication in a animal that have be sensitize by the same substance . the amino acid , glutamic acid , and leucin , the amino acid , glutamic acid , and leucin , likewise fail to show distinct antigenic property . a anticasein or antiparanuclein serum do not sensitize animal sensitize to paranuclein to milk intoxication or to intoxication by a anticasein or antiparanuclein serum , and likewise fail to produce precipitin in rabbit in a preliminary experiment . we experiment be regard as a fairly systematic analysis of the antigenic property of split product of a single protein . a anticasein or antiparanuclein serum be analogous to , though less complete than the work of Wells -lrb- 6 -rrb- on egg-white . a anticasein or antiparanuclein serum seem to present the additional advantage of deal with what be probably the only protein certainly know chemically , and in the work of Wells purest form . a anticasein or antiparanuclein serum serve , moreover , as a introduction to the follow study of the antigenic property of a combined protein . 
1 . erythrocyte have definite lipoidal constituent and lipoidal combination peculiar to the species . 2 . certain lipoid and lipoidal combination act as specific antigen . 3 . the increase in serum lipase which occur upon immunization of animal to foreign red cell be , at least in part , specific . 4 . this specific lipase play , a important part in specific serum hemolys , a important part in specific serum hemolys . 
we be unwilling to draw any very definite conclusion from the experiment , partly because they show a survival of implant skin of so much shorter duration than that which seem to occur in the case of spontaneous implantation cyst , and partly because a crude way of test they vitality be rather a crude way of test   a crude way of test they vitality vitality . nevertheless , the follow point seem clear : 1 . the repeat transplantation of a piece of skin from one animal to another confer no exceptional power of growth upon implant skin of so much shorter duration than that which seem to occur in the case of spontaneous implantation cyst . 2 . the repeat implantation of skin from one animal to another decrease , if anything , the repeat implantation of    skin from one animal to another receptivity for such graft . 3 . the burial of the skin cause , after a change in the skin of such a nature , a change in the skin of such a nature that the burial of skin in the interior of the body can not resume the burial of skin in the interior of the body normal function as a external cover tissue , even when the burial of skin in the interior of the body circulation \ \ be well maintain and the burial of skin in the interior of the body circulation \ \ be bury in the body of the same animal . the experiment do not determine how long the cell of the skin actually remain alive , and indeed it be conceivable that the mere maceration of the protective horny layer put the skin , when reëxposed , into the position of a moist tissue , such as the intestinal mucosa , so that the position of a moist tissue , such as the intestinal mucosa readily dry up and succumb . nor do the experiment throw any light upon the possible existence of cytolytic substance in the circulate fluid , although , naturally , the idea of such a action have always be present in we mind in observe the gradual loss of vitality in the transplant tissue . 
the liver of the embryo chick during the first two week of development contain a abundance of isotropic fatty globule which represent a mixture of lipoid in which the phosphorized fat predominate . during the third week of incubation isotropic fatty globule in the glycerophosphoric acid portion be liberate for calcification , while the free fatty acid be esterfy by cholesterol change lipoid in which phosphorized fat predominate physical and chemical character . lipoid in which phosphorized fat predominate physical and chemical character become anisotropic and exhibit the reaction and property of ester of cholesterol . the phosphorized fat gradually disappear from the glycerophosphoric acid portion be liberate for calcification , while the free fatty acid be esterfy by cholesterol during the third week of incubation . the phosphoric acid utilize by the embryo chick in calcification be derive from the phosphorized fat . it be suggest that the phosphorized fat be split in                  the glycerophosphoric acid portion be liberate for calcification , while the free fatty acid be esterfy by cholesterol the glycerophosphoric acid portion be liberate for calcification , while the free fatty acid be esterfy by cholesterol . a comparison of the condition in atherosclerosis with those of the develop chick liver , and a comparison of the condition in atherosclerosis with those of the develop chick liver , suggest that pathological calcification result from a splitting in situ of phosphorized fat with subsequent formation of calcium salt , as suggest by Baldauf . 
1 . excise ring of the coronary artery of the ox properly weighted react to epinephrin by dilatation . 2 . this reaction of the ox coronary be not a active dilatation , but be in the nature of a sudden lowering from a high to a relatively low degree of tonus . the tonus be not , however , entirely abolish by epinephrin . 3 . the degree of relaxation produce by epinephrin be not constant . the degree of relaxation produce by epinephrin depend on several factor other than the concentration of epinephrin use . 4 . it be possible to increase the sensitiveness of the coronary artery of the ox to epinephrin . 5 . there be no evidence of any primary constrictor effect on the ox coronary from epinephrin in most dilute solution , nor can the existence in this artery of any constrictor mechanism of sympathetic origin be determine by the excise ring method . 
1 . the modify Meyer method here propose , of parallel test upon segment of survive carotid and coronary artery from the ox , be a satisfactory means for detect epinephrin in complex body fluid like blood . 2 . at the present time there be no evidence that epinephrin , in amount sufficient to produce the present time physiological effect upon any hitherto use test object , exist in the circulate blood , with the exception of blood from the suprarenal vein . 3 . the examination of uncoagulated blood from six person with high blood pressure have fail to show the presence of epinephrin or other constrict substance . 4 . the constrictor substance in defibrinate blood and serum be not the constrictor substance in defibrinate blood and serum . in the constrictor substance in defibrinate blood and serum point of action and the constrictor substance in defibrinate blood and serum the present time physiological effect the constrictor substance in defibrinate blood and serum point of action and the constrictor substance in defibrinate blood and serum the present time physiological effect be similar to barium chlorid . the constrictor substance in defibrinate blood and serum point of action and the constrictor substance in defibrinate blood and serum the present time physiological effect be a direct stimulant to smooth muscle and seem to have no relation to the sympathetic innervation of muscle . 
the asexual cycle of separate and distinct species have be cultivate in vitro in human blood . the parasite have be grow also in red blood cell in the presence of Locke 's solution , free of calcium chlorid and in the presence of ascitic fluid . the parasite grow within red blood cell in the presence of Locke 's solution , free of calcium chlorid and there be no evidence that they can be grow outside of red blood cell in the presence of Locke 's solution , free of calcium chlorid . the parasite be destroy in a very few minute in vitro by normal human serum or by all modification of serum that we have test . this fact , together with numerous observation of parasite in all stage of growth apparently within red blood cell in the presence of Locke 's solution , free of calcium chlorid , render untenable the idea of extracorpuscular development . leucocyte phagocytize and destroy malarial plasmodium grow in vitro only when the parasite escape from they red blood cell capsule or when the latter be perforated or become permeable . successive generation of    separate and distinct species have be cultivate in vitro by remove leucocyte phagocytize and destroy malarial plasmodium grow in vitro only when  the parasite escape from they red blood cell capsule or when the latter be perforated or become permeable . from the culture and by transplant to fresh red blood cell and serum at proper interval . the asexual cycle of plasmodium vivax and plasmodium falciparum cultivate in vitro do not differ from the same cycle grow in vivo . the sexual cycle have not be cultivate , though we have obtain some evidence of the possibility of the sexual cycle accomplishment . there can no longer be any doubt that    separate and distinct species be separate and distinct species . when grow in a identical culture medium and under exactly the same condition plasmodium vivax and plasmodium falciparum cultivate in vitro remain distinct . in twenty-nine culture of aestivo-autumnal parasite many form and size have be observe , so that evidence be supply of the occurrence of different variety of aetivo-autumnal malarial plasmodium . the so call tertian aetivo-autumnal variety may be see at the proper stage in all culture grow from merozoite . the form and appearance of the same culture of plasmodium may vary greatly under different condition which be not necessarily destructive to the parasite . the so call tertian aetivo-autumnal variety generation period may vary from thirty hour -lrb- aetivo-autumnal -rrb- to four day -lrb- tertian -rrb- , as a result of variation in the temperature at which the so call tertian aetivo-autumnal variety be cultivate . sexual parasite grow in twenty-nine culture of aestivo-autumnal parasite and be more resistant to unfavorable condition than schizont , often live several day after the latter die out . form suggest parthenogenesis have be observe . 
virulent pneumococcus inject into the cranial or spinal cavity of monkey produce constantly a meningitis closely resemble pneumococcus meningitis in man , except that the experimental disease pursue a more rapid course to the invariable death of the untreated animal . a homologous immune pneumococcus serum inject into the spinal canal exert a restrain influence upon the experimental disease to the extent that when employ early a homologous immune pneumococcus serum prevent , exceptionally , the occurrence of infection and thus save the life of the untreated animal , and when give later a homologous immune pneumococcus serum at first retard the experimental disease but subsequently exert no beneficial action and be powerless to save life . a mixture of sodium oleate , immune serum , and boric acid exert regularly a more powerful action than immune serum alone , and not only prevent the occurrence of infection but also , when administer repeatedly , arrest the progress of a actually establish infection and lead , often , to the enduring and perfect recovery of the inoculate animal . it be propose to employ a similar mixture in the direct treatment of pneumococcic meningitis and possibly of still other accessible local pneumococcic infection in man . 
without claim any close analogy between the autolytic change and pigmentation in pathological process , it have , we believe , be show that iron-containing , as well as other kind of pigment , may be form during the autolytic degeneration of parenchymatous cell independently of the hemoglobin in the blood stream , and hence may be derive from the proteid constituent of the cell the cell . 
aside from the nerve fiber which enter the pace-making node from the subepicardium , there be observe within the limit of the node a few ganglionic cell and a plexus of moniliform nerve fibril in very close relation to the node a few ganglionic cell muscle fiber , hence the sino-auricular node , like the auriculo-ventricular , may be consider from a histological standpoint a neuromuscular organ . 
1 . spirochoeta gallinarum can be cultivate in suitable artificial media for many successive generation and probably for indefinite period . the presence of fresh tissue and a certain amount of oxygen seem to be essential for the presence of fresh tissue growth . no perceptible odor be produce in the culture . 2 . the maximum growth of spirochoeta gallinarum be reach on about the fifth day , but the phase of degeneration commence slowly and gradually , so that in this respect spirochoeta gallinarum differ from the duttonus , kochus , obermeierus , or novyus , whose culture be characterize by sudden onset of degeneration soon after the maximum growth of  spirochoeta gallinarum be attain . 3 . no rod formation resemble bacillus arise in the course of multiplication of spirochoeta gallinarum in the culture . many round or oval body appear in old culture , but no infection of animal or formation of spiral form from these granule have be produce . the degeneration product derive from the periblast of the spirochoetoe be probably the degeneration product derive from the periblast of the spirochoetoe . 4 . culture of spirochoeta gallinarum , either old or young , do not contain a form which pass through a Berkefeld filter -lrb- v -rrb- that infect chicken or grow into the spirochaeta . 5 . spirochoeta gallinarum remain virulent for chicken after be in culture for at least thirteen generation , but spirochoeta gallinarum may become avirulent under certain cultural condition . the inoculation of chicken with the attenuate culture render the bird refractory to the subsequent infection with a virulent strain . 6 . when the spirochaeta be cultivate in the media contain rabbit kidney instead of chicken muscle , the individual specimen be somewhat thicker , but otherwise typical . 7 . spirochoeta gallinarum multiply in culture by transverse division . no positive evidence of a longitudinal division have be obtain . 
the foregoing experiment demonstrate that the immunity induce in mouse by preliminary treatment with tumor or certain of the normal tissue reach the immunity induce in mouse by preliminary treatment with tumor or certain of the normal tissue maximum at about the tenth day , after which the immunity induce in mouse by preliminary treatment with tumor or certain of the normal tissue gradually diminish , probably to disappear after the lapse of about eighty day . it be significant that the curve with the three tissue , spontaneous tumor , kidney , and embryo skin , should parallel each other so closely , and the occurrence render extremely probable the view , previously express by Russell and by Woglom after a examination of very young graft in immune mouse and rat respectively , that the resistance elicit in each case be similar . it be evident , however , that there be a difference in the degree to which three be develop . 
1 . the filter blood serum of rabbit infect with pneumococcus be not toxic . 2 . extract of pneumococcus prepare by keep emulsion of the bacterium in salt solution at 37 degree c. for vary period of time may be toxic , and when inject intravenously into guinea pig , may produce a train of symptom follow by acute death resemble that see in acute anaphylaxi . such extract , however , be not uniformly toxic and pneumococcus prepare by keep emulsion of the bacterium in salt solution at 37 degree c. for vary period of time may be toxic , and when inject intravenously into guinea pig have be impossible to discover the exact condition under which such extract become toxic . 3 . when the centrifugalize peritoneal washing of guinea pig infect with pneumococcus prepare by keep emulsion of the bacterium in salt solution at 37 degree c. for vary period of time may be toxic , and when inject intravenously into guinea pig be inject into the circulation of normal guinea pig , these animal very frequently exhibit symptom follow by acute death resemble that see in acute anaphylaxi like those see in acute anaphylaxi , and a considerable proportion of these animal die acutely . 4 . when pneumococcus prepare by keep emulsion of the bacterium in salt solution at 37 degree c. for vary period of time may be toxic , and when inject intravenously into guinea pig be dissolve in dilute solution of bile salt and the solution result be inject intravenously into rabbit and guinea pig , these animal show with great constancy the same symptom that be see in acute anaphylaxi . the solution of pneumococcus in bile may occur in ten minute at 37 degree c. or in half a hour on ice . this be consider evidence that the toxicity of the solution of pneumococcus in bile do not result from digestion of the bacterial protein , but be due to substance preformed in the bacterial cell and set free on this the solution of pneumococcus in bile . the toxicity of  the solution of pneumococcus in bile be diminish or destroy by heat to 55 degree c. or over . 
these experiment demonstrate that protective substance be usually present in the blood of patient recover from lobar pneumonia . as a rule , the appearance of protective body in the blood of patient recover from lobar pneumonia , when demonstrable , coincide rather sharply with the period of critical fall in temperature and the disappearance of symptom . protective substance be not present in the blood in any measurable degree before the crisis , but afterward patient recover from lobar pneumonia may reach a considerable concentration . in certain instance , protective substance either become evident some time after the occurrence of the crisis , or can not be demonstrate at any period of the disease . experiment in which it be possible to test serum against a homologous strain of pneumococcus yield in the majority of case evidence of the presence of protective body in  the blood of patient recover from lobar pneumonia ; whereas in those in which stock culture be use , the serum , as a rule , show no protection . the development of specific protective substance in the serum of patient recover from lobar pneumonia suggest that protective body in  the blood of patient recover from lobar pneumonia may play a part in the mechanism of recovery . 
study of the bacteriology of the blood be make in thirty-seven case of lobar pneumonia . the pneumococcus be isolate from the blood in approximately 50 per cent . of the case study . the course of blood infection be more severe than in those in which no organism could be cultivate from the blood . 77 per cent . of the patient with positive blood culture die , and 79 per cent . of patient with negative blood culture recover . in fatal instance of pneumonia , where the pneumococcus be find in the blood , the number of organism per cubic centimeter of blood be very high in the last stage of the disease . in individual die of pneumonia without blood infection , the disease be characterize by a rapid spread of the local process in the lung . it be not unlikely that the symptom of collapse , develop on the fifth or sixth day of lobar pneumonia , be often the expression of serious invasion of the blood by the pneumococcus . in other instance , individual die of pneumonia without blood infection mark a extension of the lung . strain of pneumococcus isolate from the blood of the patient be usually of high animal virulence . in a few instance where the organism isolate from the blood be of low virulence for animal , the patient recover . the protective power of a univalent antipneumococcus serum be test against nineteen strain of typical pneumococcus and against four strain of closely ally organism . a univalent antipneumococcus serum manifest some degree of protection against twelve out of nineteen strain of typical pneumococcus . no protection be observe against the atypical organism . in eight instance the degree of protection obtain be high , in three low , and in one there occur only a prolongation of the period of life of the inoculate animal . 
the coagulation time of the blood be generally prolong during the acute stage of lobar pneumonia , return to normal during the period of convalescence . there seem to be a simultaneous increase in the quantity of circulate fibrinogen . the lengthening of the coagulation time of the blood be probably due to a increase formation of antithrombin . the source of the increase antithrombin and fibrinogen be probably the source of the increase antithrombin and fibrinogen , and the stimulus to increase production of these two substance be due to the nature of the infect organism . 
a constant feature in pneumonia be a constant feature in pneumonia . occasional case , however , may fail to show low carbon dioxide . the carbon dioxide in  a constant feature in pneumonia bear little definite relation to the severity of the disease , except that the carbon dioxide in   a constant feature in pneumonia tend to be lowest in severe case and in the terminal stage of the disease . there be less deviation from the normal in short or mild case . the carbon dioxide in   a constant feature in pneumonia bear no immediate relation to temperature , as a constant feature in pneumonia may persist for some day after the patient be afebrile . the carbon dioxide in   a constant feature in pneumonia correspond to the other evidence of metabolic change in infection and , like they , may be even greater after than during the febrile period . the change in       a constant feature in pneumonia of the blood run parallel to the output of ammonia in the urine . the carbon dioxide in   a constant feature in pneumonia appear to bear no immediate relation to chlorine excretion . in two unusual case  a constant feature in pneumonia be normal or above normal . this be associate with a very low oxygen content of the venous blood . 
the most striking feature observe in this study be the most striking feature observe in this study the most striking feature observe in this study . it be find that in certain disease the globulin fraction be markedly increase , whereas nearly all the protein may be normal , or may fall far below normal in amount . the disease in which a increase in the globulin take place may be group as follow : -lrb- 1 -rrb- cardiac disease associate with decompensation and serous effusion , -lrb- 1 -rrb- cardiac disease associate with decompensation and serous effusion -lrb- 1 -rrb- cardiac disease associate with decompensation and serous effusion , and -lrb- 4 -rrb- parenchymatous nephritis . in the serum of chronic parenchymatous nephritis the increase in the globulin content be most pronounced and may constitute nearly all the protein , or as much as 95 per cent . the globulin content of serum be normal or diminish in the following disease : -lrb- 1 -rrb- simple achylium gastrica -lrb- short duration -rrb- , -lrb- 2 -rrb- tuberculosis , -lrb- 3 -rrb- diabetes insipidus , and -lrb- 4 -rrb- chronic interstitial nephritis . other ingredient of the serum analyze show variation which can not be definitely classify ; but in a general way it appear upon careful analysis that a accumulation of water and salt occur in those disease in which the globulin fraction of the blood serum be increase . 
it MAY be conclude from the result obtain in THESE experiment : 1 . that stimulation of the right vagus nerve in the dog usually cause arrest of all the chamber of the heart . 2 . that stimulation of the left vagus nerve exert a moderate negative chronotropic effect on the auricle . 3 . the left vagus nerve have a profound effect on the conduction of impulse over the auriculoventricular system . 4 . that the degree of effect exercise on the auriculoventricular system by the left vagus nerve vary . in some dog conduction be depress to a extent which cause only a delay in the conduction of no impulse to the ventricle ; in still other dog the conduction of impulse from the auricle be depress to a degree which result in incomplete heart-block ; while in still other dog conduction be so depressed that although the auricle continue to contract , no impulse pass from the auricle to the ventricle . 5 . that when stimulation of either the right or leave the left vagus nerve cause asystole of nomotopic ventricular contraction , ectopic ventricular contraction ,   nomotopic ventricular contraction , ectopic ventricular contraction , ectopic ventricular contraction may occur . 6 . that the time which elapse before   nomotopic ventricular contraction , ectopic ventricular contraction ,     nomotopic ventricular contraction , ectopic ventricular contraction , ectopic ventricular contraction occur depend upon the irritability of the ventricular muscle , and this may vary in different dog . 7 . the left vagus nerve may rarely cause sino-auricular block . possibly stimulation of either the right or leave  the left vagus nerve may also produce a profound effect on the conduction of impulse over the auriculoventricular system . 8 . 8 there be consequently usually 8 . 
the result of THIS study of the change in the blood after splenectomy and of the effect of the administration of hemolytic serum allow the follow tentative conclusion : 1 . the failure of a hemolytic serum to cause jaundice be due in some way to the anemia which frequently follow splenectomy . animal , whether splenectomize or not , which have a low blood count and low hemoglobin content do not readily develop jaundice after the administration of hemolytic serum . on the other hand , in animal with a normal blood picture such a serum readily cause , during early period after splenectomy , a well marked jaundice . 2 . the difficulty of produce hemoglobinemia and jaundice in animal splenectomize one month or more , be due , as show by blood count , the use of hypotonic salt solution test , and by the search for the presence of hemoglobin in the serum and urine , to a increase in the resistance of the red cell . the result of detailed serologic test upon this point will be present later . 3 . it be possible that spontaneous jaundice occur at long period , seven to ten month after splenectomy be a accompaniment of the complete regeneration of the blood after splenectomy and of the effect of the administration of hemolytic serum . the study of the blood in animal splenectomize for long period , seven to ten month , seven to ten month , indicate that spontaneous jaundice occur only when the animal have recover from the initial period of anemia and have a high red cell count and high hemoglobin content . 4 . as to the mechanism responsible for the anemia follow splenectomy and for the increase resistance of the red cell , we can at present offer no explanation . 
1 . the erythrocyte of splenectomized dog show increase resistance to the action of hypotonic salt solution and to specific hemolytic immune serum . the degree of resistance appear to increase with the length of time that have elapse after splenectomy . 2 . this increase resistance of the erythrocyte of splenectomized dog be not due to a increase antihemolytic power of the animal 's serum or to a diminish complementary value of the animal 's serum , but be a property depend upon this . 3 . non-splenectomized animal receive a single injection of specific hemolytic immune serum and develop a temporary anemia show likewise on recovery a increase resistance of the corpuscle without the presence of antihemolysin in demonstrable amount . 4 . as a characteristic result of splenectomy be a characteristic result of splenectomy , a characteristic result of splenectomy would appear that a increase resistance of the corpuscle without the presence of antihemolysin in demonstrable amount be a increase resistance of the corpuscle without the presence of antihemolysin in demonstrable amount and be thus analogous to the increase resistance of such cell not infrequently observe in various form of experimental anemia . 5 . there be no evidence to indicate that the anemia after splenectomy be due to the presence of hemolytic body , or that the increase resistance of such cell not infrequently observe in various form of experimental anemia be due to antihemolytic body , accumulate in the serum as the result of the ablation of the spleen in some . it be evident therefore that the spleen in some way control or regulate blood destruction -lrb- and regeneration ? -rrb- , and in the hope of throw light on the subject , a investigation of the bone marrow and lymph node of splenectomized dog be now under way . 
in a large proportion of dog that have be splenectomize for period of two week or more , one find a great increase in the number of endothelial cell of the lymph node . in most splenectomized dog that succumb to a injection of hemolytic immune serum within forty-eight hour , the sinus of the lymph node contain large number of endothelial cell , phagocytic for red cell . this be not see in normal dog receive hemolytic serum . likewise a similar power of phagocytosis be see frequently in the stellate cell of the capillary of the liver . both in the lymph node and the liver the stellate cell of the capillary of the liver appear to be form in situ ; we find no evidence that both have be transport to these organ . such finding suggest the development of a compensatory function on the part of the lymph node and possibly of the liver . normally the spleen , this function of form red blood corpuscle-phagocyting cell contain cell which have the power to engulf and presumably to destroy the red blood corpuscle . in certain pathological condition a compensatory function on the part of   the lymph node and possibly of  the liver be frequently greatly augmented and may sometimes be share by the lymph node , for example , in typhoid fever , as be first clearly show by Mallory . we observation suggest that in the absence of the spleen , this function of form red blood corpuscle-phagocyting cell , this function of form red blood corpuscle-phagocyting cell , normally a minor activity of the lymph node , become highly develop in the latter organ , and that the stellate cell of the capillary of the liver , and the liver , thus assume , in part at least , the function of destroy the red blood corpuscle by phagocytosis . in view of the somewhat limited material at we disposal , we offer this , not as definitely conclusive , but as evidence which , in connection with the work of other , be highly suggestive of the possibility of the lymph node assume some of the function of  the spleen , this function of form red blood corpuscle-phagocyting cell , this function of form red blood corpuscle-phagocyting cell . whether this activity of the endothelial cell of   the lymph node and the liver  the stellate cell of the capillary of the liver have any bearing on the anemia that follow splenectomy and on the occurrence of spontaneous jaundice in the late period after splenectomy , be not yet clear . 
it will be see that uranium nephritis , which involve both tubule and glomerulus , the former more markedly than the latter , produce a marked accumulation of nitrogen in the blood . Chromate nephritis , which involve almost exclusively both tubule and glomerulus , produce only moderate retention of nitrogen . the latter more severely than do uranium , the latter more severely than do uranium , produce a marked accumulation of nitrogen , begin early and persist for a considerable period . the experiment be control by test the blood of normal cat keep under the same condition , . this general statement be in accordance with the physiological classification of these nephritide except that the retention in uranium occur at a early stage , where , accord to the physiological study of Schlayer and Schlayer associate , and of Pearce , Hill , and Eisenbrey , the vascular change have not as yet appear . it must be notice that in the three type of nephritis that form the subject of this investigation , anatomical study show the glomerulus to be distinctly involve in the two form where only moderate accumulation be most marked , only moderate accumulation . the accumulation of non-protein nitrogen in the blood and tissue be not large when compare with the total intake or elimination of nitrogen , and consequently it be practically impossible by means of ordinary nitrogen equilibrium experiment to demonstrate the fact of      only moderate accumulation , to say nothing of determine the degree of accumulation of waste product accompany nephritis . the accumulation of non-protein nitrogen in  the blood and tissue both can be demonstrate by the method employ in this research be clearly show by the figure record ablove . 
as a result of this study it may be state that primary splenomegaly of the gaucher type be a distinct disease , relate in all probability to the blood disease . a result of this study begin usually at a early age , frequently affect several member of a family , and run a chronic course . the clinical manifestation be : pronounced hypertrophy of the spleen , subsequent enlargement of the liver , where they be destroy , a tendency to epistaxi or other hemorrhage , a tendency to epistaxi or other hemorrhage , a tendency to epistaxi or other hemorrhage , discoloration or pigmentation of the skin , and a tendency to epistaxi or other hemorrhage . the lesion be find in the spleen ,   a tendency to epistaxi or other hemorrhage , bone marrow , and liver . these organ show the presence of iron-containing pigment , and large multinuclear cell with a characteristic cytoplasm . in the early case peculiar large phagocytic cell arise from atypical large lymphocyte be find in the follicle -lrb- keimcentra -rrb- of the hemapoietic system . after leave the follicle -lrb- keimcentra -rrb- of the hemapoietic system peculiar large phagocytic cell arise from atypical large lymphocyte possess phagocytic quality for a certain period . as a result of the phagocytosisthe cell enlarge , the nature of the cytoplasm change , and the phagocytosisthe cell acquire a characteristic vacuolated and wrinkled appearance . the phagocytosisthe cell be carry from the spleen through the portal system to the liver , where they be destroy , where they be destroy . the irritation produce by this destructive process give rise to a increase in the intralobular connective tissue . a chronic one , without any of the manifestation of malignancy be eminently a chronic one , without any of the manifestation of malignancy , without any of the manifestation of malignancy , and always terminate as the result of some intercurrent affection . the etiology be unknown , although a family predisposition to some toxic agent which cause a irritability of the follicle in the hemapoietic system probably exist . the possibility of some protozoan infection as a etiological factor must not be overlook . 
the domestic fly -lrb- Musca domestica -rrb- can carry the virus of poliomyelitis in a active state for several day upon the surface of the body and for several hour within the gastro-intestinal tract . mosquito -lrb- culex pipien , culex sollicitan , and Culex cantator -rrb- , in we experiment , have not take up and maintain in a living state the virus of poliomyelitis from the spinal cord of monkey . louse -lrb- pediculus capitis and pediculus vestimentus -rrb- have not take the virus of poliomyelitis out of the blood of monkey or maintain the virus of poliomyelitis in a living state . the bedbug -lrb- Cimex lectularius -rrb- have take the virus with the blood of monkey from infected monkey and maintain the bedbug -lrb- Cimex lectularius -rrb- in a living state within the body for a period of seven day . 
1 . leucoprotease split the pneumococcus into lower cleavage product than be obtain with the autolytic ferment contain in the pneumococcus . 2 . such cleavage product inject into rabbit have the property of produce immune body in the blood of the inject animal . 3 . these experiment indicate that proteolysis play a part in the production of pneumococcus immunity . 
in the thirty-two unselected case study , culture be take from both the blood and the sputum , and in five of these more than one blood culture be take . in one case the culture be take from the blood only , and in this instance the pneumococcus be find . one case will be consider only with reference to the incidence of the pneumococcus in blood culture in lobar pneumonia . the result in the thirty-two case in which culture be make both from the blood the sputum be as follow : 1 . in eleven case the blood and sputum culture be positive . -lrb- a -rrb- in nine case the pneumococcus be isolate , and five of these patient die . -lrb- b -rrb- in two case , instead of the pneumococcus , streptococcus hemolysan -lrb- longus -rrb- be find . one of these patient die . 2 . in twenty-one case the blood and sputum culture be negative , and in eighteen of these the blood and sputum culture be positive and in these three . in these three the only result record be the absence of the pneumococcus . -lrb- a -rrb- in nine case the pneumococcus be isolate . two of these patient die . -lrb- b -rrb- in twelve case the pneumococcus be find . two of these patient die . of the patient in which the pneumococcus be find , in two case bacillus coli be isolate ; in one case micrococcus catarrhali ; in one case a staphylococcus -lrb- type not state -rrb- ; in two case staphylococcus and streptococcus ; in one case bacillus influenza , in one case bacillus fluorescen non-liquefacien ; in one case a unidentified gram positive chromogenic organism , probably saprophytic ; and in these three case there be no record result except that the pneumococcus be absent . in the total of thirty-three blood culture , the pneumococcus be find in ten case -lrb- 30.3 per cent . -rrb- , and six of the patient die . during the year 1910 to 1912 sputum culture be take from forty-four case of pneumonia , of which twenty-four show pneumococcus -lrb- 54 per cent . -rrb- , and twenty show no pneumococcus -lrb- 45 per cent . -rrb- . 
pancreatic tissue implant in the spleen and separate from the spleen original vascular and nervous connection can live and functionate for month . a small nodule of pancreatic tissue compose of acinus without demonstrable island of langerhan prevent the development of diabetes . death occur 187 day after the extirpation of the pancreas . 
closed duodenal loop may be make in dog by ligature place just below the pancreatic duct and just beyond the duodenojejunal junction , together with a posterior gastro-enterostomy . these close duodenal loop dog die with symptom like those of patient suffer from volvulus or high intestinal obstruction . this duodenal loop may simulate closely a volvulus in which there have be no vascular disturbance . the closed duodenal loop survive a little longer on the average than animal with unwashed loop . the duration of life in the first instance be one to three day , with a average of about forty-eight hour . the dog usually lose considerable fluid by vomit and diarrhea . a weak pulse , low blood pressure and temperature be usually conspicuous in the last stage . autopsy show more or less splanchnic congestion which may be most marked in the mucosa of the upper small intestine . the peritoneum be usually clear and the closed loop may be distend with thin fluid , or collapse , and contain only a small amount of pasty brown material . the mucosa of the closed loop may show ulceration and even perforation , but in the majority of case the mucosa of  the closed loop be intact and exhibit only a moderate congestion . simple intestinal obstruction add to a closed duodenal loop do not modify the result in any manner , but a closed duodenal loop do not modify the result in any manner may hasten the fatal outcome . the liver play no essential role as a protective agent against this poison , for a dog with a eck fistula may live one to three day with a closed loop . a normal dog react to intraportal injection and to intravenous injection of the toxic substance in a identical manner . drainage of this loop under certain condition may not interfere with the general health over a period of week or month . excision of the part of the duodenum include in this loop under certain condition cause no vascular disturbance . the material from the closed duodenal loop contain no bile , pancreatic juice , gastric juice , or split product from the food . the material from the closed duodenal loop can be form in no other way than by the activity of the intestinal mucosa and the growth of the intestinal bacterium . this material after dilution , autolysis , sterilization , and filtration produce a characteristic effect when introduce intravenously . when in toxic dose this material after dilution , autolysis , sterilization , and filtration cause a profound drop in blood pressure , general collapse , salivation , vomit and diarrhea , , salivation , vomit and diarrhea , , and profuse diarrhea ,   salivation , vomit and diarrhea , , be often blood-stained . splanchnic congestion be the conspicuous feature at autopsy and show especially in the villi of the duodenal and jejunal mucosa . Adrenalin , during this period of low blood pressure and splanchnic congestion , will cause the usual reaction when give intravenously , but apply locally or give intravenously Adrenalin cause no bleaching of the engorged intestinal mucosa . Secretin be not find in the duodenal loop fluid , and the loop material do not influence the pancreatic secretion . intraportal injection of the toxic material give a reaction similar to intravenous injection . intraperitoneal and subcutaneous injection produce a relatively slow reaction which closely resemble the picture see in the closed duodenal loop dog . in both case there be a relatively slow absorption , but more or less splanchnic congestion which may be most marked in the mucosa of the upper small intestine and other finding , though less intense , be present in both group . there seem , therefore , to be no escape from the conclusion that a poisonous substance be form in this closed duodenal loop which be absorb from a poisonous substance and cause intoxication and death . injection of this toxic substance into a normal dog give intoxication and a reaction more intense but similar to a reaction develop in a closed-loop dog . 
the blood of closed duodenal loop dog be not toxic to normal dog . the blood of dog that have be fatally poison with duodenal loop fluid be likewise non-toxic to normal dog . the mucosa of closed or drain duodenal loop contain a toxic substance quite similar to the toxic material find in the luman of the closed loop which have a intact mucosa . a toxic substance be absorb from a toxic substance and not from the luman of closed or drain duodenal loop . the same be probably true of the closed loop which have a intact mucosa . the same seem highly probable that the poison be form by the essential factor in the elaboration of the poisonous material and be in great part absorb directly from the same by the blood of dog that have be fatally poison with duodenal loop fluid . normal intestinal mucosa contain a toxic substance nor can a toxic substance neutralize in vitro the toxic substance produce in the closed loop which have a intact mucosa . there be no evidence that the toxic material when give intravenously be excrete by the intestine or hold by the intestinal mucosa in any demonstrable form . a toxic substance be not absorb from the normal intestinal tract . Destruction of the mucosa in a closed loop by means of sodium fluoride prevent the formation of a toxic substance . this fact furnish the final proof that the essential factor in the elaboration of the poisonous material be the essential factor in the elaboration of the poisonous material . 
1 . Cholesterin , whether suspend in dilute alcohol or in sodium oleate solution , when inject directly into the tumor cause a marked acceleration both of the primary and of the metastatic growth . 2 . the acceleration of the primary growth be most evident in the premetastatic stage . 3 . Lecithin , when inject in the form of a aqueous emulsion directly into the tumor , diminish the tendency to form metastase , retard the metastatic growth when Lecithin do occur , and in some instance also retard the primary growth . 4 . the retardation due to lecithin be most evident in the metastatic stage . 5 . simultaneous injection of m/6 strontium chloride solution into the tumor do not appreciably affect the action of Lecithin . 
the intrabronchial insufflation of a non-virulent pneumococcus cause , like the insufflation of a virulent pneumococcus , the development of a exudate in the lung which , in general , leave the framework unaffected , and the lesion present the gross appearance of a lobar pneumonia . the intrabronchial insufflation of a non-virulent pneumococcus differ , however , materially from the pneumonia produce by virulent pneumococcus in the important point that the consolidation tend to a more rapid resolution , the disease be non-fatal , the blood be not invade by the organism , and a exudate in the lung be strikingly poor in fibrin . as to the question which be the start point for the foregoing investigation , namely , whether the pneumonic lesion produce by the streptococcus be merely the pneumonic lesion produce by the streptococcus , the question which be the start point for the foregoing investigation may be answer for the dog , the question which be the start point for the foregoing investigation seem , in the negative . a strong enough feature to form a divide line between the two form of experimental pneumonia previously describe , be a strong enough feature to form a divide line between the two form of experimental pneumonia previously describe . 
while one can not assert that the conclusion which experiment appear to offer must of necessity correspond to the condition which arise clinically in man , nevertheless these result , if definite , must tend to show the direction in which the truth lie . the conclusion which may be draw from this research be as follow : 1 . direct infection of the medullum of a long bone be unlikely to lead to the development of a tuberculous osteomyelitis . 2 . inoculation of the interior of a joint with tubercle bacillus readily produce tubercle of the synovial membrane . 3 . from such a infected joint the epiphysis or metaphysis of a long bone become diseased . 4 . infection of the arterial heart blood do not result in the local development of tubercle of the bone or joint . 5 . infection of the main artery supply a limb lead to the development of tuberculous disease of certain of the joint of a limb . 6 . direct infection of the nutrient artery do not result in tuberculous osteomyelitis of a long bone . 
the first specimen of Ammocoetes branchiali that show histologically any atrophic change in the endostyle be take on July 16 . histologically any atrophic change proceed relatively rapidly for about a month , after which the endostyle as such be no longer recognize . all specimen examine after August 15 show in cross section the characteristic ductless follicle more or less completely form . more gradual and minor change in the way of further absorption of cell remnant and completion of the characteristic ductless follicle more or less completely form continue at least until September 1 . two specimen take from the creek on September 4 , 1911 . show complete follicle formation with some stainable colloid -lrb- figure 14 and 15 -rrb- . there be still yellow granular pigment in the fibrous tissue between the characteristic ductless follicle more or less completely form . in two specimen take on October 14 , 1909 , the pigment be absent and the characteristic ductless follicle more or less completely form be more closely set , larger , and contain homogenous colloid . in the twenty-four specimen of ammocoete study , there be variation in the time of the onset of metamorphosis . there may also be variation in the rate of progress of the change in different specimen . there be no evidence that removal of the animal from ammocoete study native environment to the laboratory either increase or decrease the rate of metamorphosis . Schneider state that Schneider be unable to get specimen keep in the laboratory to undergo metamorphosis . Gage , however , have repeatedly observe the metamorphosis under laboratory condition , and the six of we specimen keep in the laboratory-some for forty days-remained in excellent condition and the metamorphosis proceed as well as in those live in the creek on September 4 , 1911 . i know of no observation bear on the question as to whether the metamorphosis may be hasten or delay as the metamorphosis can be in tadpole and other amphibium . the question as to whether  the metamorphosis may be hasten or delay as the metamorphosis can be in tadpole and other amphibium be probable , however , that physical condition greatly influence the transformation . these observation as to the length of time from the inception to the completion of metamorphosis indicate that a month and probably longer be necessary for the lake and brook lamprey of Central New York . this be in agreement with the observation of Gage and of Muller on metamorphosis in general , but be at variance with the view of Bujor , who state that the process take place within three to four day . the first endostylar change be a gradual shrinkage in the whole organ with thicken of the capsule and septum and proliferation of the connective tissue in the periendostylar zone . the tongue anlage be develop in this thicken just dorsal to the endostyle and anterior to the gland orifice . the size of the chamber progressively decrease and with the thicken of septum and proliferation of the connective tissue in the periendostylar zone the half of the endostyle be both absolutely and relatively more separated . all the five type of epithelium be affect , the first to show the change be type i , the four fan-shaped bundle of cuneiform cell of each half of the endostyle . these disappear totally quite early . the next type to show marked change be the next type to show marked change , or the cell with yellow pigment granule . here the change be progressive and these cell group in different stage of atrophy may be trace through to the fully develop follicle . the endothelial-like lining of the parietal wall of  the chamber , or the endothelial-like lining of the parietal wall of the chamber , be pile up and extrude laterally as the chamber contract or shrink . these cell in different stage of atrophy may be follow until the metamorphosis be near completion . it be certain that the cell of type i , the next type to show marked change , and v play no part in the formation of the characteristic ductless follicle more or less completely form . with type ii and iv the question as to whether  the metamorphosis may be hasten or delay as the metamorphosis can be in tadpole and other amphibium be not so easily settle as ii be from one or the other or from both of type ii and iv that the permanent follicle arise . one can say definitely that type iv play the major role , but whether the cell of type ii after fusion with the basal group of type iv do not also share in the formation of the ventral follicle of the give chamber , i can not decide , but from the evidence obtainable this seem probable . it be significant that type iv be continuous with , and indi 
1 . a extract of horse leucocyte be strongly bactericidal when dissolve in distilled water ; a extract of horse leucocyte have considerable bactericidal power when dissolve in physiological saline ; but a extract of horse leucocyte lose a extract of horse leucocyte bactericidal property when mix with blood serum or with normal or pathological tissue fluid . 2 . about half the antibactericidal action of blood serum be due to the serum colloid , about a quarter to the neutral serum crystalloid , and a quarter to the diffusible alkali . diffusible acid have half the antibactericidal action of blood . 3 . the addition of boric acid to a inactive mixture of leucocytic extract and serum or other body fluid occasionally restore part of the original bactericidal power , but never more than a small fraction of the original bactericidal power . 
the experiment show that intrabronchial insufflation of a culture of virulent pneumococcus kill by heat and still contain stainable organism produce a inextensive , mild , patchy , superficial inflammation of the lung tissue bear no similarity to the lesion produce by the living pneumococcus , and that insufflation of sterile bouillon cause a pronounced congestion of the lung tissue bear no similarity to the lesion produce by the living pneumococcus with which insufflation of sterile bouillon come in contact , sometimes last for forty-eight hour . 
a abnormal auricular activity be produce by the faradization . a abnormal auricular activity consist of a rapid auricular tachycardia coexist with true auricular fibrillation . in some dog the auricle be throw into a abnormal auricular activity more readily by faradization after the vagus have be cut than before . cut the nerve have little or no effect on a abnormal auricular activity , but the ventricular rate may be much increase if the vagus be cut after a abnormal auricular activity have be establish , apparently because of a improvement in the auriculoventricular conductivity . stimulation of the right vagus nerve change the character of the activity of the faradize the auricle by inhibit a rapid auricular tachycardia coexist with true auricular fibrillation while the fibrillation be uninfluenced . leave vagus stimulation have little or no apparent inhibitory effect on a rapid auricular tachycardia coexist with true auricular fibrillation , but have possibly a inhibitory effect on the auricular fibrillation . leave vagus stimulation increase the susceptibility of the auricle to faradization . the abnormal activity set up by faradization may be establish in heart otherwise refractory by vagus stimulation of short duration follow the faradization . leave vagus stimulation usually hold the auricle in the abnormal activity set up by faradization as long as leave vagus stimulation be continue in heart in which , without leave vagus stimulation , the sequential beat always return as soon as faradization be stop . the right vagus be more effectual in this respect than the left . in some heart leave vagus stimulation alone be capable of initiate the same abnormal auricular activity which be cause by auricular faradization . the normal sequential beat be often restore by leave vagus stimulation . the normal sequential beat replace a abnormal auricular activity not during , but a few seconds after , the termination of leave vagus stimulation . leave vagus stimulation be somewhat more effectual in produce this result than right vagus stimulation . 
the follow conclusion may be draw from the result obtain in this study . 1 . in the minor surgical case -lrb- consider normal -rrb- the chemical composition of the blood serum agree , as far as the chemical composition of the blood serum protein be concern , with the usual standard value . when examine at different time , the serum of such case show no variation in the total protein content or in the serum of such case individual fraction . the incoagulable nitrogen , however , vary considerably in the total amount in the different case , as well as in the incoagulable nitrogen percentage relation to the other constituent of the serum of such case . 2 . the case of prostatic hypertrophy , with or without chronic interstitial nephritis , show no change from the normal in the character of the protein composition of the serum of such case , nor in the ratio which the serum of such case individual fraction bear to each other . on the other hand , the incoagulable and non-protein nitrogen of the serum of such case show marked fluctuation , some of which correspond to the degree of functional deficiency of the kidney . 3 . in case of localized infection of the kidney , the change in the blood serum be twofold . one concern the chemical composition of the blood serum protein , and be traceable to the infection ; and the other concern the incoagulable and non-protein nitrogen of  the serum of such case , result from functional impairment , and vary with the amount of destruction of the kidney substance . thus a increase in the globulin be observe in these serum similar to that occur in infection in other locality ; the non-protein content increase apparently in direct proportion to the degree of deficiency of the kidney , and become diminish when the function of the kidney improve . 
1 . a single intravenous injection into dog of a sufficient number of freshly wash typhoid bacterium produce the symptom and pathology that characterize anaphylaxi in these animal . 2 . these effect be not produce by the coagulable protein-free filtrate from a fresh emulsion , while the toxic portion of the bacterial body be change from a coagulable to a non-coagulable state be very potent , the toxic portion of the bacterial body be change from a coagulable to a non-coagulable state . 3 . the symptom and pathology describe be not specific , since a coagulable can be produce by substance other than typhoid toxin . 4 . digestion with leucoprotease furnish a method of liberating toxic substance from typhoid bacterium resemble the process of nature more closely than the method heretofore use . 5 . the toxic substance thus liberate be not destroy by a heat and acid precipitation of the coagulable protein , and be of the nature of primary proteose . 
a osteochondrosarcoma of the common fowl , designate in this laboratory as Chicken tumor vii , have be successfully transplant to seven successive series of host . the original growth contain bone and cartilage , be attach to the sternal keel of a otherwise healthy chicken , and appear to have arise from this structure . in the growth derive from the original growth transplantation cartilage be regularly lay down , follow later by bone in case the host live long enough . the prechondral tissue consist of spindle-shaped or multipolar cell of the fibroblast type . the histological character and the behavior of the prechondral tissue show that the behavior of   the prechondral tissue be sarcomatous , a fact further prove by one recent case in which the tumor have metastasize . the secondary growth in this instance consist of prechondral tissue in which a cartilaginous change be take place . the tumor could not be transfer to the one foreign species test , the one foreign species test , but grow readily in chicken of two alien breed . reinoculation experiment suggest the occurrence of a natural , individual immunity , and of a certain degree of acquire resistance . in one fowl visceral growth develop follow a intravenous injection of tumor emulsion , although whether they be due to this cause or be secondary to the large implantation growth in the muscle be uncertain . recently the tumor have be transmit by means of the filtrate from a Berkefeld filter . 
inoculation of the Jensen rat sarcoma into the develop chick embryo give a rapidly grow tumor at the site of inoculation , whether in the membrane or in the body of the chick inoculation of the Jensen rat sarcoma into the develop chick embryo . these tumor by transfer from the develop chick embryo can be keep go for as long as forty-six day , and perhaps indefinitely in the foreign species . the rat cell show no morphological change even after a very long dependence . they biological character be also retain , as be show by the fact that the cell when replant in the rat , after a prolonged sojourn in the chick , will produce a rapidly grow sarcoma of the Jensen type . these rat tissue grow for long period in the chick show no adaptation to the new species , be destroy even more rapidly when place in the adult chicken than the cell . morphologically the cell retain a close resemblance to those in the original tumor . various embryonic cell from the chicken , mouse , and rat , the Ehrlich sarcoma and chondroma of the mouse be   various embryonic cell from the chicken , mouse , and rat , the Ehrlich sarcoma and chondroma of the mouse . 
1 . in primary culture sarcoma cell exhibit a much greater activity than do normal connective tissue cell grow from the adult blood vessel ; there be a shorter latent period , ameboid phenomenon be more marked , and cell multiplication proceed more rapidly . 2 . in secondary culture sarcoma cell be less active than in primary culture ; normal connective tissue cell grow from the adult blood vessel , on the other hand , show a markedly accelerate growth . 3 . normal connective tissue cell grow from the adult blood vessel be more easily propagate over long period in vitro than be sarcoma cell ; they multiply actively in culture more than three month old . 4 . the method of tissue cultivation be well adapt to the study of normal and pathological cell division ; the nuclear change be easily discernible in the living cell as division proceeds , and staining method may be apply to verify observation upon the unstained structure . 5 . atypical mitosis of several kind be find in culture of sarcoma cell but be not see in growth of connective tissue . 6 . the time require for division in rat normal connective tissue cell grow from the adult blood vessel keep at body temperature -lrb- 38 degree c. -rrb- vary within relatively narrow limit -lrb- twenty to fifty minute -rrb- ; sarcoma cell , on the contrary , exhibit marked variation and several hour may be require . 7 . in study upon living cell amitotic division have not be observe in either normal or tumor tissue . evidence of nuclear bud , however , with the formation of living cell contain several nucleus of irregular size have be note . -lrb- 3 -rrb- the development of a cell with two nucleus from a mononuclear cell by mitotic division of the nucleus without division of the cytoplasm have also be observe . 
1 . the report successful transfer of scarlet fever to both higher and lower monkey be not definitely establish . 2 . in the course of the experiment here report , the infectious agent can be assume to have be carry over to lower monkey . the failure to cause infection probably proceed from the insusceptibility of the monkey employ , or to the manner of introduce the infectious agent . 3 . the temperature curve and leucocyte count of the monkey employ be the temperature curve and leucocyte count of the monkey employ . 4 . the monkey employ frequently have transient blotchy , erythematous eruption on the face and neck , and almost always a bran-like desquamation . 5 . the monkey employ be highly resistant to infection with microorganism from human being . 
it be obvious , as state in the beginning , that these experiment have fail to reproduce a chronic pulmonary tuberculosis . acute pneumonic process of tubercular origin be , however , not infrequent as a complicating or terminal process in pulmonary phthisis , and there have be several case describe in which individual have die with the symptom complex of acute lobar pneumonia , in which a complicating develop at post-mortem examination that the disease be tuberculosis . these experiment throw some light on debate question in connection with these acute pneumonic form of phthisis . in these experiment believe that have effectively reproduce this exudative type of tuberculosis of the lung . this type of lesion may , in the light of these experiment , result from the sudden bronchogenic invasion of large number of virulent tubercle bacillus in a relatively resistant animal . the large mononuclear cell so frequently encounter in the exudate seem to be bring there chiefly from outside . -lrb- 1 -rrb- as Orth find when study human material , it be difficult here also , to exclude the possibility that similar cell may result from the desquamation of alveolar epithelium . the tubercle bacillus alone , without the aid of secondary infection , be competent to produce a type of lesion which lead to the necrosis , and by discharge of the necrotic material to cavity formation . as judge by these experiment the bronchus be less resistant to involvement in the necrosis than be the blood vessel or pleural surface . the fact that by the method of bronchial insufflation of Lamar and Meltzer a characteristic tuberculous pneumonia may be produce make the fact that by the method of bronchial insufflation of Lamar and Meltzer a characteristic tuberculous pneumonia may be produce probable that the lobar pneumonia generally be of bronchogenic origin . 
this study of globin and this study of globin compound with casein -lrb- this study of globin -rrb- show that globin fail to produce fixation antibody in rabbit after repeat injection , thus agree with we own work and with that of other with similar histon body which be primarily toxic . when globin be combine with casein , however , this study of globin give rise to antibody that react not only with globin caseinate and casein but also with globin . the antibody in antiglobin casein serum be apparently the antibody in antiglobin casein serum the antibody in antiglobin casein serum . in other word , the change in globin undergo on combination with casein have apparently render the change in globin undergo on combination with casein antigenic . we do not succeed in demonstrate the genesis of this new antigenic property by anaphylaxi experiment . a further investigation of similar and more complex combined protein be indicate and give promise of more light on the nature of biological specificity . 
1 . Mallory 's connective tissue stain use in connection with fixation of tissue by Zenker 's fluid or bichloride of mercury demonstrate the presence or absence of iodin in the thyroid colloid , as be evidence by parallel chemical determination , iodin feeding , and test-tube experiment . 2 . greatly increase activity of the heart be accompany by a loss of thyro-iodin from the thyroid colloid . 3 . this method , while apparently not adaptable to clinical use , may prove of value in further experimental work on  the thyroid colloid . 
the datum bring together in this report have be gather from a wide territory and for a period extend over several year . the antimeningitis serum be first employ in 1906 and the latest figure relate to the antimeningitis serum use include in this report be furnish in 1912 . there be no longer doubt that the antimeningitis serum have come to be apply under condition fairly represent all know manifestation of epidemic meningitis . hence the test of the serum treatment may be regard as have be a rigorous one . the initial difficulty surround the administration by direct subdural injection have be largely overcome and doubtless will be still further master . already the antimeningitis serum be be successfully apply in private as well as in hospital practice . this gain will probably be reflect in a still further diminution of the mortality since early injection play such a large part in determine the result achieve . the 1,300 case study in this report be a part only of a far greater number of case actually treat with the serum supply by the Rockefeller Institute . 1,300 be not find possible to secure history of all the case treat ; but there be no reason to suppose that the result of the analysis would have be essentially different if report of a still larger number of case have be return . the decision arrive at be not base upon statistical computation alone , but upon objective datum as well that be not readily misinterpret . the conclusion that follow be first state in 1909 as the result of a analysis of 400 serum-treated case . the conclusion that follow be support by the study of the larger series of case just present . `` in view of the various consideration present , the conclusion that follow may be draw that the antimeningitis serum , when use by the subdural method of injection , in suitable dose and at proper interval , be capable of reduce the period of illness ; of prevent , in large measure , the chronic lesion and type of the infection ; of bring about complete restoration of health , in all but a very small number of the recover , thus lessen the serious , deform , and permanent consequence of meningitis ; and of greatly diminish the fatality due to the disease . '' 
the reduction of the oxygen capacity which occur after incubate pneumococcus culture with wash rabbit corpuscle be due to the formation of methemoglobin -lrb- or some derivative of hemoglobin with identical optical constant for three region in the spectrum -rrb- . the substance which induce the change be also present in the sterile filtrate of autolyzed culture . by analogy we feel justified in conclude that the mechanism of the reduction of the oxygen capacity in human lobar pneumonia be at least in part of the same nature . to determine the frequency and intensity of the phenomenon in lobar pneumonia , and thereby to establish the phenomenon in lobar pneumonia clinical significance , be the next step and a problem upon which we be now engage . 
normal and eck fistula dog react in a similar manner to the intravenous injection of hemoglobin obtain from laked red cell of the same animal . hemoglobin appear in the urine after a few minute and bile pigment in one to one and one half hour . in this simple type of hematogenous jaundice the reaction be in no way influence by shut out the portal blood from the liver and cut down the portal blood from the liver blood supply to about 25 per cent . of normal . in a second type of hematogenous jaundice produce by chloroform anesthesia , which produce central liver necrosis , there be no essential difference between the normal and eck fistula dog . the normal and eck fistula dog , as a rule , be more resistant to this poison , but , give a definite liver necrosis , the jaundice develop will reach a definite liver necrosis maximum on the second day as in the normal animal . the jaundice develop must be explain in part by capillary biliary obstruction , but in part by a hemolysin form in the injured liver cell -lrb- Joannovics and pick -rrb- . simple obstruction of the common duct when combine with a eck fistula give rise to a definite low grade icterus with the bile pigment . under these condition after doubly ligate and cut the common duct when combine with a eck fistula with separation of the cut end , the luman of the common duct when combine with a eck fistula may be establish and bile may enter the intestine by means of a fistulous tract between the cut end of the bile duct . the formation of a few minute and bile pigment in one to one and one half hour be much less in a eck fistula dog than in a normal animal and consequently a definite low grade icterus with bile pigment constantly present in  the urine be much less intense . this be probably due to a lessened activity of the injured liver cell -lrb- Joannovics and pick -rrb- because of decrease blood supply . this observation do not harmonize with the current view that a few minute and bile pigment in one to one and one half hour be form solely from hemoglobin , as there be no evidence of more hemolysis in a normal than in a eck fistula dog . this suggest that the bile pigment may be form in part , at least , from other substance than hemoglobin , and , further , that bile pigment formation normally may depend in part upon the functional activity of the liver cell rather than upon the amount of hemoglobin supply to this suggest that the bile pigment may be form in part , at least , from other substance than hemoglobin , and , further , that bile pigment formation normally may depend in part upon the functional activity of the liver cell rather than upon the amount of hemoglobin . 
the intravenous injection of red cell obtain from the same animal and lake by distilled water be similar to certain type of hemolysis which result in hematogenous jaundice . this procedure can not be criticize on the grounds of introduce toxic substance . the hemoglobin circulate in the blood stream be rapidly change , in part at least , to the bile pigment . the change go on with practically the same rapidity in a normal circulation , in a eck fistula animal , and in a dog with eck fistula and hepatic artery ligation . moreover , the bile pigment formation go on in a dog whose liver , spleen , and intestine have be shut out of a normal circulation , and in those with a head and thorax circulation . in the last experiment there have be no operative manipulation of liver , spleen , and intestine and the bile pigment could not have escape from liver , spleen , and intestine and have be absorb by the circulation above the diaphragm ; for example , by the thoracic duct . it be possible that the endothelium of the blood vessel be the agent which bring about the rapid change of hemoglobin to the bile pigment . this mechanism probably come into play when there have be a destruction of many red cell with much hemoglobin free in the plasma . we may conclude that in dog , at least , hemoglobin can be rapidly change into the bile pigment in the circulate blood without participation of liver , spleen , and intestine . 
in summarize the finding of this paper this paper may be say that degenerative change have be note in practically every parenchymatous organ . among these the most striking have be that of serous imbibition by the most active cell of these organ . in regard to degenerative change in the gland of internal secretion , the finding of this paper corroborate the statement of cushing in regard to hypophysectomy , that removal of one gland of internal secretion result in change in all the other gland . in this case , degenerative change predominate in the hypophysis , thymus , ovary , and testis , while hyperplasium be see in the island of langerhan and the medulla of the adrenal gland . finally , in the rabbit athyroidism be responsible for grave degenerative change in practically all organ and tissue of the body , and many of the symptom of cretinism have a anatomical basis in organic cellular change . 
the experiment here record , as well as those precede they and outline in the introductory paragraph , have have the purpose of analyze the phenomenon of alexin fixation occur when dissolve , unformed protein be add to those precede they specific antisera . the present experiment have show that specific precipitate have the same relation to the complement fraction first describe by Ferrata that be possess by sensitize cell . in this this differ from indifferent suspension , like kaolin , which fix alexin and the complement fraction indiscriminately , fix the end-piece without dependence upon previous adsorption of the mid-piece . the writer believe this to be of theoretical importance since it seem to show , in the first place , that the alexin be not merely a mechanical adsorption , and in a mechanical adsorption a mechanical adsorption render more likely the supposition that the so call precipitin be actually the so call precipitin . the visible precipitation in such reaction be merely secondary , occur because of the colloidal nature of the react body , under condition of quantitative proportion and environment which favor flocculation . the visible precipitation in such reaction do not seem necessary to assume a structure for the so call precipitin essentially different from that of other sensitizer . carry to the visible precipitation in such reaction logical consequence , the acceptance of this view , take the identity of agglutinin and precipitin at least as a possibility , lead to the conception that functionally there be but one variety of specific antibody , and one be one . 
1 . in a series of non-nephritic individual the total non-protein nitrogen of the blood , determine by Folin 's method , be find to lie between 15 and 43 milligram per 100 cubic centimeter . from 50 to 60 per cent . of this be in the ammonia-urea fraction . 2 . in cardiovascular disease with renal congestion , but without other renal lesion , there be no evidence of increase of non-protein nitrogen in the blood , nor of alteration of the ammonia-urea percentage . 3 . in chronic nephritis with marked albuminurium and edema there be very little , if any , increase or alteration . 4 . in chronic nephritis with hypertension the total non-protein nitrogen of the blood , determine by Folin 's method be definitely increase , range from 40 to 180 milligram per 100 cubic centimeter of blood . the percentage of the ammonia-urea fraction be usually higher than in non-nephritic case . 5 . we case be subject to rapid fluctuation in    we case in the course of a few day . as a rule , clinical improvement be associate with a fall of the non-protein nitrogen figure to nearer the normal range . 6 . uremia be almost always accompany by a increase of non-protein nitrogen in the blood , but no constant relation could be establish between the degree of increase and the tendency to uremia . 7 . we case have not yet be follow for a long enough period to admit of conclusion as to the possible relation between the degree of non-protein nitrogen retention and ultimate prognosis . 8 . we believe Folin 's method to be a valuable aid in the clinical study of nephritis and that Folin 's method can be readily carry out in any well equip clinical laboratory . 
the spinal fluid in the case of acute epidemic poliomyelitis examine be usually clear , colorless , and do not appear to be under any great increase of pressure . the spinal fluid in the case of acute epidemic poliomyelitis show change in the number of cell present , or in the globulin content , or in both , in the majority of case examine on the first few day after onset of symptom . the number of cell present be usually highest during the first week , and in one case reach the figure of 1,221 per cubic millimeter . the globulin reaction be usually most mark during the third week . the number of cell present diminish rapidly and be above normal in only 32 per cent . of the case in the third week . the increase in the globulin reaction persist to the fourth week and might be present for a considerably longer period . the cell increase be due almost invariably to mononuclear cell of various type . the lymphocytic type of cell be the lymphocytic type of cell . a high polymorphonuclear count be note in the very early stage . all the fluid reduce Fehling 's solution . the examination of the spinal fluid in the case of acute epidemic poliomyelitis may be of value in diagnosis in the preparalytic stage and in abortive case . the examination of   the spinal fluid in the case of acute epidemic poliomyelitis be not of value in prognosis as to life or ultimate recovery . 
since the purpose of this paper be to record the cultivation of the amoeba upon autolyze tissue without bacterial association , the morphological characteristic , life cycle , mean of differentiate species , and pathogenicity of the protozoan have be omit . these subject will be consider in later publication . the result of this study prove that some species of amoeba from liver abscess and the human intestine can be cultivate upon various autolyzed tissue of man and some of the lower animal without a symbiotic microorganism . some of the lower animal cultivation from liver abscess upon such bacteria-free autolyzed tissue indicate that some of the lower animal multiplication in these lesion depend upon some product or product in the process of dissociation of the liver cell . that such a process exist in amoebic liver abscess can not be question when histological and biochemical study be make of such lesion , and this explain not only why the multiplication of the parasite in the organ occur , but suggest the probable origin of the lesion . that such a process have long be know that tissue keep for several day in a perfectly aseptic condition and at body heat , or preferably at slightly higher temperature undergo soften and final disintegration of several day in a perfectly aseptic condition and at body heat , or preferably at slightly higher temperature the liver cell . Wells and other who have make a thorough study of this phenomenon find that different enzymic action take place in a process : thus in the liver Wells and other who have make a thorough study of this phenomenon find that soluble nitrogen compound be greatly increase , the nucleoproteid be alter by nuclease , the purin basis be free and in the nucleoproteid turn act upon by the guanase and adenase , the fat be the fat , the glycogen give rise to glucose and undergo further splitting . lecithin be cleave , and ally body appear , and there be a marked appearance of cholin and cholesterin . similar change vary only in degree occur in the process of autolysis of other tissue . furthermore , Duval in autolysis of other tissue the cultivation experiment find that the initial multiplication be accomplish when the specific organism be in symbiosis with a associate bacterium capable of hydrolyze the leprous tissue . in later experiment Duval in        the cultivation experiment note that the product of split protein supply what be actually require for the growth of this particular obligate cell parasite , and that while this end be reach with bacterium through  the cultivation experiment proteolytic action equally good result can be obtain with tissue free from contaminate microörganisms provide that it be allow to autolyze . the separation of the amoeba cultivate from the human intestine from  the cultivation experiment bacterial symbiont , and  the cultivation experiment development upon various autolyzed tissue of man indicate that it be not the bacterium that be essential for the life of the protozoan , but the action of the living bacterium upon the protein contain in the media . this would explain the failure of many investigator to cultivate the amoeba with dead bacterium or bacterial filtrate . mention have be make that the autolyzed tissue use in the cultivation experiment give a distinct acid reaction . the multiplication of amoebae upon a medium with such a reaction appear contradictory to the finding of Musgrave and Clegg , Walker , and other , who have emphasize the necessity of a alkaline medium for the successful cultivation of amoeba with a bacterial symbiont , though in accord with what be know to be the reaction of the contents from amoebic liver abscess and of the bloody stool in intestinal amoebiosis . the fact should not be lose sight of the fact , in the amoeba , these author lay stress upon the selectiveness of amoeba for a special microörganism . a comparison of these author work with we own result indicate that bacterium know to possess strong hydrolyzing property , strong hydrolyzing property , strong hydrolyzing property , Vibrio proteus -lrb- finkler-prior -rrb- , etc. , , strong hydrolyzing property , Vibrio proteus -lrb- finkler-prior -rrb- , etc. , , etc. , furnish the best symbiont to the amoeba . it be well know that these bacterium grow upon gelatin or blood serum liquify a medium with such a reaction and alter the reaction of the contents from   amoebic liver abscess and of the bloody stool in intestinal amoebiosis to a marked degree of acidity . this acidity , for the most part , r 
1 . 1 have be find that the amount of glycuronic acid excrete in the urine , estimate by Tollens 's furfurol distillation method , be increase during the febrile period of almost all case of lobar pneumonia in man . patient weigh from fifty-five to seventy kilogram excrete during the febrile period of almost all case of lobar pneumonia in man 0.8 to 1.3 gram of glycuronic acid in twenty-four hour , while the output of a normal individual of the same weight , the same weight , and under similar condition would not exceed 0.4 to 0.6 of a gram . 2 . this increase output be not dependent on outside factor ; this be attributable to pathological change of the organism this during the disease . 3 . similar observation have be make in postpneumonic empyema and bronchopneumonium . 4 . fast rabbit , with general pneumococcus infection , have also show a marked increase in the output of glycuronic acid during the pathological process . whether the conjugate substance with the glycuronic acid in the case study have the same origin and be qualitatively the same as under normal condition , or whether we be deal with different compound , have not yet be determine . 
1 . under normal circumstance blood platelet be largely derive from the megakaryocyte of the blood-forming organ . 2 . the transitional leucocyte , represent a persistent form of the embryonic premegakaryocyte , be a circulate homologue of the megakaryocyte of the blood-forming organ and probably play some part in normal platelet formation . 3 . under condition of excessive demand for platelet production , there may be a greater or less reversion to a embryonic mode of platelet formation in which less highly specialize cell than the megakaryocyte of the blood-forming organ participate in platelet production . 4 . in addition to the megakaryocyte of the blood-forming organ , hyperplastic endothelial cell in the marrow be         . 
when connective tissue cell have be cultivate for a certain length of time in a medium which have be repeatedly change , a definite relation arise between the rate of growth of connective tissue cell and the composition of a medium which have be repeatedly change . a certain length of time be possible , by add to the culture medium a give quantity of certain substance , such as embryonic juice , to foresee the extent to which a fragment of tissue compose of a give strain of connective tissue cell will increase in a give time . the rate of growth of a strain of connective tissue cell can be accelerate or retard by the addition to the medium of activate or retard substance . the dynamic condition of a strain of connective tissue cell , which have be live in a give medium for some time , be not a definitely acquire characteristic , but a temporary state , and be the product or function of the medium in which connective tissue cell be live , and be readily modify merely by alter the composition of  a medium which have be repeatedly change . a knowledge of the characteristic of the growth of connective tissue describe have lead to a new result,-the indefinite proliferation of a strain of   connective tissue cell outside of the organism . the strain of connective tissue originally obtain from a fragment of chick embryo heart , which have be pulsate in vitro for 104 day , be still actively alive after sixteen month of independent life and more than 190 passage . the rate of proliferation of the connective tissue sixteen month of independent life old equal and even exceed that of fresh connective tissue take from a eight day old embryo . the rate of proliferation of the connective tissue  sixteen month of independent life old equal and even exceed that of fresh connective tissue take from a eight day old embryo . appear , therefore , some time have no effect on the tissue isolate from the organism and preserve by means of the technique describe above . during the sixteenth month of life in vitro connective tissue cell increase rapidly in number and be able in a short time to produce a large quantity of new tissue . this fact , therefore , definitely demonstrate that the tissue isolate from  the organism and preserve by means of the technique describe above be not in a state of survival , as be the case in certain earlier experiment , but in a condition of real life , since the cell of which they be compose , like microorganism , multiply indefinitely in the culture medium . 
in order to establish the influence of temperature upon the effect of vary dose of strychnin inject into frog , the animal must be keep under observation for several day and at various definite degree of temperature . statement that the animal be keep `` cold , '' `` at room temperature , '' or `` warm , when compare to a room temperature of 15 degree c. furthermore a animal may apparently fail to respond in  `` cold , '' to a injection of certain dose of strychnin and yet be find in tetanic convulsion the next day '' be insufficient . with a certain dose tetanus may result constantly at 30 degree c. yet never appear at 21 degree c. , and either of these temperature might be describe as warm , when compare to a room temperature of 15 degree c. furthermore a animal may apparently fail to respond in  `` cold , '' to a injection of certain dose of strychnin and yet be find in tetanic convulsion the next day , when compare to a room temperature of 15 degree c. furthermore a animal may apparently fail to respond in `` cold , '' to a injection of certain dose of strychnin and yet be find in tetanic convulsion the next day . that a animal may have late , long lasting , or strong tetanus while keep at such a low temperature as 5 degree c. after a injection of a dose of strychnin smaller than 0.01 of a milligram per frog emphasize the fact that great caution must be exercise in formulate law as to the influence of temperature on drug action . the main result of this investigation may be summarize as follow : dose of strychnin amounting to 0.0006 of a milligram per gram of frog will cause tetanus at all temperature between 5 degree c. and 30 degree c. , although at low temperature a certain dose tetanus may result constantly at 30 degree c. may appear late . a dose of 0.0003 of gram of frog will frequently produce tetanus at 5 degree c. and 30 degree c. as well as at 30 degree or 27 degree c. , but may nevertheless fail to produce any reaction at such a intermediary temperature as 21 degree c. smaller dose , 0.0002 of a milligram per gram , will cause tetanus in `` cold , '' but not at high temperature . a dose of 0.0003 of      gram of frog may be state in general that in frog keep at low temperature the tetanic state set in later , continue longer , and each tetanic attack be of longer duration , while in the interval between the attack the state of tonus be higher and the animal be more irritable than when general that in frog keep at  low temperature the tetanic state set in later , continue longer be keep at higher temperature . 
under the experimental condition outline , sodium tartrate subcutaneously introduce into rabbit fail to reappear in the urine . it be conclude that the disintegrative influence of the salt upon the convoluted tubule be sufficient to account for the failure of the salt upon the convoluted tubule to be eliminate . no evidence of a vicarious function on the part of the glomerulus be observe . 
the salt exert a markedly detrimental influence upon the secretory efficiency of the kidney , which be indicate by a greatly lessened output of certain typical urinary constituent , which be indicate by a greatly lessened output of certain typical urinary constituent . a histological study of the nephritic kidney demonstrate that the salt act specifically upon the epithelium of the convoluted tubule , and to a less extent upon the tubule of the loop of Henle , the glomerule , and interstitial tissue remain unharmed . in the disintegrative process take place , vacuolation first occur , be rapidly follow by necrosis , and finally the dead cell or the glomerule debris may entirely fill the lumina of the convoluted tubule and form granular and hyaline cast . there be no strict relation between the dose of tartrate and the extent of damage inflict . while large dose invariably induce a well marked response small dose may at time produce the effect equally significant . Tartrates introduce into fast  the salt call forth symptom practically identical with those observe in fast phlorhinized animal . it be therefore apparent that in the establishment of the pathological condition under discussion phlorhizin be without significant influence . neither the liver nor the adrenal exhibit any detrimental effect from the injection of Tartrates . the introduction of tartrate by way of the mouth to fast rabbit be not nearly so effective in the production of nephritic symptom as the administration of much smaller dose subcutaneously . in general , under the former circumstance the initial stage only of epithelial disintegration of the convoluted tubule obtain , which , however , be scarcely sufficient to account for the rapidity with which death usually ensue . although in well feed animal distinct pathological change in  the kidney , which be indicate by a greatly lessened output of certain typical urinary constituent , which be indicate by a greatly lessened output of certain typical urinary constituent be induce by the introduction of tartrate per os , these abnormality be less in degree , but similar in kind , than those provoke under like condition in the fasting animal . when Tartrates be give subcutaneously to well feed rabbit the effect evoke be somewhat less pronounced than when the salt be inject into fast animal . from these fact it be evident that the state of nutrition play a part in the development of tartrate nephritis . it be indicate that the introduction of a sufficiency of the alkali permit a greater elimination of certain typical urinary constituent during tartrate nephritis than obtain under similar circumstance when the alkali be omit . Histologically there be evidence that the administration of alkali exert a slight modify action . 
after the intravenous introduction of a solution contain sodium chloride and urea into the rabbit during pronounced tartrate nephritis , all the chloride reappear in the urine within forty-eight hour . on the other hand , the nitrogen of the urine within forty-eight hour remain far below that usually eliminate by the normal animal under the experimental condition ; in other word , little or none of the urea inject be excrete by the kidney . in the light of the histological finding these result be interpret to mean these result under normal condition chloride and water be pass through the glomerular mechanism , whereas urea become a urinary constituent by way of the convoluted tubule . these result constitute a direct confirmation of the older observation of other concern the elimination by the kidney of the substance under discussion . no evidence be obtain that the glomerulus may take over the function of the tubular epithelium . 
1 . the blood flow in the foot be smaller per unit of volume of the part than in the ratio of foot flow , the ratio of foot flow to hand flow per 100 cubic centimeter of the part usually lie in normal person between 1 to 3 and 1 to 2 . 1 to 2 . in the supine position , with the leg hang down , the foot seem to be somewhat greater than in the sit position . 
1 . in the fever case the flow in the foot never exceed the normal flow and be usually much below the normal 2 . in explanation of the relatively small foot flow in the fever case it be suggest that the vasoconstrictor mechanism of the peripheral part , especially of the skin , be abnormally excite , and some direct evidence that the case be the case be bring forward . 3 . the significance of this hypersensitiveness , or at least increase action , of the cutaneous vasoconstrictor mechanism be assume to be that a compensatory arrangement which secure for the organ mainly suffer from the infective process a increase flow of blood be a compensatory arrangement which secure for the organ mainly suffer from the infective process a increase flow of blood . 4 . on this hypothesis the rise of temperature be , chiefly at least , secondary , inevitably follow a compensatory arrangement which secure for the organ mainly suffer from the infective process a increase flow of blood , provide that the metabolism be , upon the whole , not diminish . 5 . accordingly the rational treatment of hyperpyrexium , or of pyrexia if 5 be consider necessary to treat 5 , be to abstract heat by a process which will not diminish and may even increase the cutaneous vasoconstriction . this condition be exactly fulfil by the cold bath , at least as regard this condition initial effect . other so call tonic effect of the cold bath be not consider here . antipyretic drug which act by dilate the cutaneous vessel would seem to be inferior in this regard . they diminish the function of the peripheral vasoconstriction to insure , the function of the peripheral vasoconstriction to insure be true , but at the cost of defeat the beneficial redistribution of the blood which the function of the peripheral vasoconstriction to insure be the function of the peripheral vasoconstriction to insure . 6 . it be obvious that for the elimination of a give quantity of heat from the skin by radiation and conduction in fever , a smaller cutaneous blood flow will suffice than with normal body temperature , since the elimination of heat per gram of blood pass through the surface must be greater in fever owing to the greater difference of temperature between the surface of the body and the elimination of heat per gram of blood pass through the surface surroundings . I be much indebted to the staff of the City Hospital for they coöperation which have render this investigation possible . 
it have be show for the first time that the nerve fiber grow out from piece of cerebellum of young cat and guinea pig , when cultivate in coagulated plasma . the same phenomenon have be observe in culture of spinal ganglion . the nerve fiber do not anastomose and they extend into the plasma unaccompanied by structure of any kind . 
ultraviolet light rapidly kill the cell of a transplantable sarcoma of the fowl without notably injure the etiological agent associate therewith . the Roentgen ray have little effect on either the cell of a transplantable sarcoma of the fowl or agent . fowl manifest two sort of resistance to the avian tumor , one direct against the implant tumor cell as the other against the action of   the etiological agent associate therewith , the other against the action of the etiological agent associate therewith to cause a neoplastic change . in the individual fowl the two resistance appear to be independent of one another , though they may exist together or may both be absent . a recognition of they will perhaps explain some feature in the biology of other tumor . 
1 . the serum of rabbit treat intravenously with neosalvarsan , and of syphilitic patient treat intravenously with salvarsan or neosalvarsan , have a definite spirochaeticidal action upon spirochoeta duttonus . 2 . although a definite spirochaeticidal action be exert in vitro , it can be demonstrate only after the treat spirochaeta be inject into susceptible animal . 3 . a curative action of the serum of neosalvarsan-treated rabbit be exercise on mouse infect with spirochoeta duttonus . 4 . the spirochaeticidal action of the serum of salvarsan-treated rabbit and patient be markedly increase by heating at 56 degree c. for thirty minute . 5 . the increase spirochaeticidal action produce by heating be due in part to the destruction of some inhibitory substance contain in normal serum and in part to a direct effect of the heat upon the serum and salvarsan mixture . 6 . cerebrospinal fluid do not contain some inhibitory substance contain in normal serum and in part to a direct effect of the heat upon the serum and salvarsan mixture present in normal unheated serum . 
electrocardiographic examination of rabbit during the anaphylactic reaction reveal marked and various change of the heart 's activity in twenty-two out of twenty-four animal . marked and various change of the heart 's activity occur in fatal as well as in non-fatal case , after the vagus be cut as well as when they be intact . cardiac disturbance be thus a practically constant result of serum anaphylaxi in the rabbit . it therefore be possible that anaphylaxi play a role in the causation of certain cardiac derangement in man . 
after splenectomy anemia usually develop quickly and reach its height in from three to six week ; then with gradual improvement the blood picture approach the normal after about three to four month , with complete return to normal in five to ten month . accompany this be marked leucocytosis reach this its height in twenty-four hour but persist to a slight degree for several month . variation , however , may occur , in that the anemia may develop slowly and be of slight degree , or the reparative process may be delay and up to five to ten month incomplete . the anemia be , however , inevitable , as be also , later , some degree of repair . 
the increase resistance of the red blood corpuscle characteristic of the splenectomize animal be as evident one year after removal of the spleen as the increase resistance of the red blood corpuscle characteristic of the splenectomize animal be at earlier period . so also be the decrease tendency to jaundice after the administration of hemolytic serum . the increase in resistance of the red cell can not be explain on the basis of a increase in reticulated cell in the circulate blood . 
the most striking point bring out in this study be that as long as a definite pressure be maintain in either the pulmonary or bronchial circulation , the admixture of blood be extremely limit . it be easily conceivable that more mixture occur normally than under the condition of the experiment , but there be no reason for consider a large difference to be a large difference . if , however , in either system a definite pressure sink to zero the possibility of supply by the other system become evident . a definite pressure take much longer for the mass inject through the bronchial artery to penetrate to all part of the lung than when the mass be inject through the pulmonary artery ; but when accomplish , the injection reach to all capillary include those of the pleuron , the only vessel remain uninjected be the larger trunk of the pulmonary artery . on the other hand , the injection of the bronchial vessel by way of the pulmonary artery be not complete with normal pressure , but occur rapidly when a high pulmonary pressure be employ . it be therefore probable that either circulation can suffice for the simple nutritive demand of the lung if the other system be interfere with . the lung have be show that embolism of the pulmonary artery , without other circulatory disturbance , do not lead to necrosis of the affected area of the lung , but it be probable that the preservation of circulation be not due to collateral bronchial circulation so much as to the free anastomosis and early division into capillary of the pulmonary artery . in support of this statement be the fact that the appearance be not alter when the bronchial be ligate at the bronchial origin . the same ligation show no subsequent interference with the nutrition of the bronchus up to a period of five week , demonstrate that the pulmonary circulation be sufficient to provide for the nutrition of the bronchus . if , however , as Virchow have show , the pulmonary artery supply a entire lobe be occluded , a entire lobe can and do suffice for the nutrition of a entire lobe . in the case of the occlusion of a branch of the pulmonary artery the pressure in the affected area of  the lung interfere with do not sink to zero because of the collateral circulation in the affected area of  the lung ; whereas , if the main trunk be occluded no collateral supply be available , a definite pressure sink to zero , and the pulmonary artery supply a entire lobe be occluded , the bronchial circulation become available as a source of blood supply . it must be remember that the lung tissue , as a whole , have ready access to oxygen and the nutritive element acquire by the blood in the lung be the nutritive element acquire by the blood in the lung . from these study the lung tissue would appear that the part of the lung tissue not in intimate contact with oxygen in the air be supply by oxygenate blood of the bronchial artery , and that the tissue through which the pulmonary blood circulate take up whatever organize nutriment they need from the pulmonary blood and possibly provide for they oxygen and carbon dioxide interchange -lrb- which must be very slight -rrb- either directly with the alveolar air , or by find sufficient oxygen in the venous blood of the pulmonary artery . the study of the inject specimen confirm Küttner 's finding of a very rapid break up of the pulmonary artery into capillary of   the pulmonary artery . in all the the inject specimen study it be find that although the pleural vessel can be inject by way of the bronchial artery when there be zero pressure in the pulmonary artery , yet when the two set of the pleural vessel be inject simultaneously in the dog , the pleural vessel invariably derive they supply of injection mass from the pulmonary artery . 
from this series it be conclude that increase in pulmonary pressure improve the circulation in the embolic area and that decrease in pulmonary pressure limit the circulation in the same area . in this series the bronchial vessel show no tendency to take up the circulation in the area of pulmonary embolism until the pulmonary pressure be as low as zero , and then only to a limited degree . this series have be show , however , that in the circulation of a entire lobe the fall to zero pressure in the pulmonary circuit be follow by almost complete take over of the circulation by the bronchial arterial supply and the most reasonable explanation of why this do not occur when embolism be present in a smaller branch of the pulmonary artery break be the most reasonable explanation of why this do not occur when embolism be present in a smaller branch of the pulmonary before the pulmonary artery break up into the branch small enough to be occlude by seed of about three millimeter in diameter . from series 2 it be conclude that although increase in pressure in the bronchial artery cause somewhat greater inflow of bronchial injection mass into the embolic area , as well as those , extremely high pressure be not sufficient to provide for complete circulation in the same district . this fact would tend to support further the belief that the anastomosis between the two vascular system occur before the smaller division of the pulmonary artery be reach . from series 3 it be conclude that with a zero pressure in the pulmonary artery there be improve injection of the embolic area through the bronchial artery which be to be expect when it be remember that a zero pressure in   the pulmonary artery favor a take over of the bronchial circulation . what pressure be find in the smaller pulmonary vessel be supply by the bronchial . series 3 have be show that the anastomosis between the two vascular system probably occur before the branch be reach which would provide lodgment for the turnip radish seed . the pressure supply by the bronchial would naturally be less beyond this point and hence improve injection of the embolic area through the bronchial artery which be to be expect when it be remember that zero pressure in   the pulmonary artery favor a take over of the circulation by the bronchial system would be less complete in the embolic area , as well as those than in the normal lung . this be show to be the case by the result of the experiment . from series 4 it be conclude that the absence of pressure in the bronchial circulation favor a better injection of the embolic area , as well as those through the pulmonary vessel , which be to be expect when it be recall that not until  a zero pressure in   the pulmonary artery be reach in the bronchial circuit do the pulmonary artery supply the bronchial vessel with blood , which be to be expect when it be recall that not until a zero pressure in   the pulmonary artery be reach in the bronchial circuit do the pulmonary artery supply   the pulmonary vessel , which be to be expect when it be recall that not until  a zero pressure in   the pulmonary artery be reach in the bronchial circuit do the pulmonary artery supply the bronchial vessel with blood , which be to be expect when it be recall that not until  a zero pressure in   the pulmonary artery be reach in the bronchial circuit do the pulmonary artery supply the bronchial vessel with blood . throughout the study it be find that whenever the two vascular system be inject simultaneously the pleural vessel over the embolic area , as well as those , as well as   the embolic area , as well as those , as well as those over the normal lung , receive the pulmonary artery supply from   the pulmonary vessel , which be to be expect when it be recall that not until  a zero pressure in   the pulmonary artery be reach in the bronchial circuit do the pulmonary artery supply the bronchial vessel with blood , which be to be expect when it be recall that not until  a zero pressure in   the pulmonary artery be reach in the bronchial circuit do the pulmonary artery supply       the pulmonary vessel , which be to be expect when it be recall that not until  a zero pressure in   the pulmonary artery be reach in the bronchial circuit do the pulmonary artery supply the bronchial vessel with blood , which be to be expect when it be recall that not until  a zero pressure in   the pulmonary artery be reach in the bronchial circuit do the pulmonary artery supply the bronchial vessel with blood . when only one system be use for injection the pleural vessel over   the embolic area , as well as those , as well as   the embolic area , as well as those , as well as those show about the same degree of injection as those of only one system . 
the tumor be generally the same as those of the normal tissue , chiefly guanine and adenine , little more than trace of xanthine , and relatively small amount of hypoxanthine be find . no uric acid be find in the tumor of this series . in one tumor , a embryonal adenosarcoma in a pig 's kidney , a large amount of hypoxanthine , and no adenine be find , while the yield of xanthine be also unusually high . this result can not be explain at present on experimental grounds , but evidently a nucleic acid complex contain no adenine be encounter . possibly hypoxanthine be present in inosinic acid . the purine enzyme be generally the purine enzyme in the tumor as in the normal tissue from which the tumor be derive . this fact sometimes make this fact possible to learn by chemical study from the tumor tissue , when the microscopic evidence be inconclusive . although the sheep liver contain the enzyme xanthine oxidase , it may be absent from primary tumor in the sheep liver , as the sheep liver have also be show to be from secondary tumor in the human liver . as the enzyme xanthine oxidase be one of the last of the purine enzyme to develop in the embryonal organism , the enzyme xanthine oxidase absence in a malignant tumor contain otherwise the same purine enzyme as the tumor tissue from which the enzyme xanthine oxidase be derive , be the enzyme xanthine oxidase absence in a malignant tumor contain otherwise the same purine enzyme as  the tumor tissue from which the enzyme xanthine oxidase be derive . 
1 . the smallest amount of the sodium soap necessary for the complete hemolysis of 0.5 of a cubic centimeter of a 5 per cent . suspension of the red blood corpuscle of the sheep , ox , rabbit , dog , or of man , be about the same,-0 .03 of a milligram in the case of the following acid : oleic , linoleic , dibromostearic , chloriodostearic , and two isomeric monobromostearic acid ; in the case of erucic acid about twice as much of the soap be find to be necessary ; in that of palmitic or of dihydroxystearic acid more than ten time as much . 2 . the minimum hemolytic quantity of the sodium soap of the highly unsaturated acid obtain from cod liver oil and from linseed oil be only very slightly less than that of sodium oleate . 3 . 3 follow , therefore , from these result that hemolysis by unsaturated fatty acid be not more active in proportion to the degree to which the highly unsaturated acid obtain from cod liver oil and from linseed oil be unsaturated , nor be 3 diminish when the unsaturated carbon atom be saturate by halogen . it be , on the other hand , greatly diminish when that of sodium oleate be convert into the corresponding hydroxyl acid , which be hemolytic only to the same degree as the saturated acid . 4 . the idea that toxic hemolysis , in disease , in poisoning by phosphorus or toluylene diamine , result from the liberation of specially hemolytic fatty acid from the fatty complex of disintegrate cell be not well support by evidence ; none of specially hemolytic fatty acid , still less any of the fatty complex of disintegrate cell from which the highly unsaturated acid obtain from cod liver oil and from linseed oil can be obtain in any of the organ examine , either in this work or in the work of other that have precede this work , show on analysis any evidence for the existence of fatty acid more toxic than the common oleic acid which be constantly be set free by hydrolysis from common fat in health . 
the essential point of OUR result be as follow : the saprophytic bacillus megatherium produce a definite pulmonary lesion which in gross appearance resemble the lesion of lobar pneumonia . one of intense leucocytic exudation which , as in some other case of experimental lobar pneumonia , do not invade the framework of the lung be one of intense leucocytic exudation which , as in some other case of experimental lobar pneumonia , do not invade the framework of the lung . but the exudate contain no fibrin . there be practically no bacillus , either in the heart 's blood or in the lung . the growth of two colony from one of the case hardly change the rule . one of intense leucocytic exudation which , as in some other case of experimental lobar pneumonia , do not invade the framework of the lung do not progress after twenty-four hour ; nor do one of intense leucocytic exudation which , as in some other case of experimental lobar pneumonia , do not invade the framework of the lung show a definite increase in extent or intensity with the increase in quantity of the inject culture . the resolution of the exudate begin practically at the end of twenty-four hour and be far advance on the third day . although there be considerable leucocytic infiltration there be no phagocytosis apparent twenty-four hour after inoculation . take all the fact into consideration one gain the impression that the lesion produce by the saprophytic bacillus megatherium differ only quantitatively from that produce by a avirulent pneumococcus . the fact stand out prominently that a saprophytic bacterium be capable of produce a pneumonic lesion similar in gross appearance to that of mild lobar pneumonia . it be not improbable that other saprophyte may be capable of produce pneumonic lesion which , in specific instance , may resemble lobular pneumonia . 
compare the pneumonic lesion produce by this very virulent streptococcus with those cause by a mildly virulent strain of the same organism , we find that with one exception the difference between those cause by a mildly virulent strain of the same organism be only of a quantitative nature and not striking . there be the same intense leucocytic exudation into the alveolus and the leucocytic infiltration of the framework of the lung . macroscopically the pneumonia produce by the virulent organism be , as a rule , lobular in character . occasionally , however , especially when large dose of the culture have be give , the gross appearance of the lesion give the impression of a lobar pneumonia . but even in these case the cut surface show that the solid area be separate by softer and lighter area of aerated , congested , or edematous lung substance . Pleurisy be practically absent from the lung in this series of these experiment ; only one case show a narrow strip of fibrinous exudate on the pleuron . although in some instance large dose of the culture be give and some dog be permit to live six or seven day , there be no mortality among the dog in these experiment , just as there have be none among the animal experiment upon with the streptococcus of very low virulence . the course of the pneumonia cause by the virulent organism seem to be somewhat longer than that produce by the less virulent one ; area of resolve pneumonia be find to persist on the sixth and seventh day after the injection , and in one such instance the solid focus contain viable organism . there be some difference in the amount of fibrin present in the exudate cause by the two strain of streptococcus . although even in these experiment the amount of fibrin present be less than that find in the lesion produce by the virulent pneumococcus , even in  these experiment the amount of fibrin present be perceptibly larger than the very small amount find in the lesion cause by the less virulent strain of streptococcus . it should be mention that there be no difference in the degree of phagocytosis observe in these two series of these experiment . no difference in the degree of phagocytosis observe in these two series of these experiment be not mark in either case . one point of no difference in the degree of phagocytosis observe in these two series of these experiment be note : during the first forty-eight hour after insufflation of the less virulent strain of streptococcus the blood of the animal obtain from the jugular vein during life and from the heart 's after death contain live organism , while in the experiment with this very virulent streptococcus with those cause by a mildly virulent strain of the same organism no living coccus be recover from the blood . the virulence of the strain of the streptococcus be , as have be point out , similar to that of the pneumococcus employ in the investigation of Lamar and Meltzer and in many of we own experiment , as far as mouse be concern , since both kill mouse weigh fifteen gram in dose of 0.000,001 of a cubic centimeter in twenty-four to thirty-six hour . the finding in the lesion cause by these two organism be comparable and therefore some deduction may be draw regard the similarity or dissimilarity of that of the pneumococcus employ in the investigation of Lamar and Meltzer and in many of we own experiment , as far action . one of the first thing we wish to bring out be one of the first thing we wish to bring out . as we new investigation show , there be evidently no difference in this respect between the streptococcus and the pneumococcus employ in the investigation of Lamar and Meltzer and in many of we own experiment , as far . when both organism be highly virulent that of the pneumococcus employ in the investigation of Lamar and Meltzer and in many of we own experiment , as far can be find in the circulate blood of the living dog or in the heart 's blood of the dead dog during the first twenty-four or forty-eight hour after a intrabronchial insufflation . on the other hand ,   the streptococcus rather confirm in a general way we first contention that the pneumonic lesion produce by the two different organism differ distinctly in many way . there be the difference in no mortality among the dog in these experiment ; even with fairly large quantity of the culture of this very virulent streptococcus with those cause by a mildly virulent strain of the same organism no mortality among the dog in these experiment be nil in these two series of these experiment , although some of some dog be keep alive for six or seven day . the mortality of the pneumococcus infection depend upon the quantity insufflate and may amount , as Lamar and Meltzer 
anaphylactic shock in the dog , cause by the intravenous injection of horse serum into sensitize animal , may produce definite cardiac disturbance which be reveal by the electrocardiogram . these cardiac change consist of disturbance in conduction of the heart impulse , abnormality in the ventricular contraction , and other unusual disturbance of the mechanism of the heart-beat . they come on very quickly after the intravenous injection of horse serum and may be of short duration , and be not obtain during anti-anaphylaxis . they be not the result of the marked fall in blood pressure which occur , nor do the central cardiac inhibitory mechanism play a part in they production . definite cardiac disturbance which be reveal by the electrocardiogram apparently be a definite primary expression of anaphylactic shock in the dog . the right ventricle seem to be more affected than the left . 
1 . a organism be isolate and study in pure culture from case of conjunctivitis accompany by the so call trachoma body the inclusion , as well as from a case of old trachoma without the inclusion . 2 . a organism be not find in the culture make from other form of conjunctivitis in which the inclusion be absent . 3 . a organism present the morphological feature characteristic of so call trachoma body . a organism undergo a early transformation , during which the form know as initial body appear , and a later change , during which form resemble elementary granule arise , while certain intermediate form between these occur simultaneously . 4 . no definite cell inclusion could be produce in monkey by inoculate pure culture of a organism . 5 . the cultivation of this organism from a case of trachoma without no definite cell inclusion , together with the previously ascertain fact that the inclusion can be produce in suitable animal by inoculate such material directly from a human case , suggest the possibility of the organism be still present in such case of trachoma , although not in the form of no definite cell inclusion . 6 . the fact present justify the statement that by a suitable method a organism resemble the various important stage of so call trachoma body and totally distinct from the gonococcus have be obtain in a living condition , capable of indefinite cultivation from case of human trachoma and inclusion conjunctivitis . whether the organism and trachoma body be identical can not be positively state at present . but the way be now open to determine the specificity of   so call trachoma body , as well as the specificity of so call trachoma body . 
1 . Pneumococci , when freshly isolate from the body , be able to live and multiply when a small number of they be inoculate into a small amount of broth . if , however , the inoculation be make in large amount of broth , many more bacterium must be inoculate in order that they may grow . 2 . 2 require much smaller number of pneumococcus to start a growth on agar than be require to start a growth in broth . 3 . this predilection for solid medium disappear when many more bacterium be grow for some time outside the body . 4 . this phenomenon be not dependent on difference in chemical composition between the two media employ or on the presence of more available oxygen in one case than in the other . 5 . 5 be probably dependent entirely on physical difference in the two kind of the two media employ , and bear some relation to the difference in possibility for diffusion in the two media employ . 
Bürgers , Schermann , and Schreiber -lrb- 1 -rrb- study `` Auflösungserscheinungen von Bakterien , '' and conclude that ferment be probably not the main factor in such lysis . Kantorowicz come to the opinion that there be a antiferment in the body of bacterium which prevent digestion .   Kantorowicz be likewise   Kantorowicz to serum bacteriolysin . but Kantorowicz use as a standard of ferment action merely the clear up of the bacterial suspension . we report show that lysis of pneumococcus may be independent of ferment action , and that lysis of pneumococcus be not correct to assume that clear up of a bacterial suspension even in the presence of a proteolytic ferment indicate proteolysis . 
1 . tubercle bacillus inject into the peritoneal cavity of tuberculous guinea pig , rat , rabbit , dog , and monkey , rapidly disappear from the peritoneal fluid , while persist in the peritoneal fluid of normal control animal . 2 . this disappearance be in part due to a adhesion of the inject bacillus to the peritoneal leucocyte and a fixation of the leucocyte on the omentum . 3 . the inject tubercle bacillus can be recover quantitatively from the peritoneal cavity of normal guinea pig from one and one half to two hour after the injection , while from tuberculous guinea pig only 65 per cent . of the inject tubercle bacillus can be recover at this time . 4 . isolate peritoneal tissue from tuberculous guinea pig have the power of destroy tubercle bacillus in vitro . 5 . a second factor reduce the number of tubercle bacillus free in the peritoneal fluid be therefore a second factor reduce the number of tubercle bacillus . 6 . the intraperitoneal lysis be not due solely to substance present in the circulate fluid , since the phenomenon can not be produce by the circulate fluid in vitro , and since a lytic power can not be passively confer even by a direct transfusion of blood from tuberculous to normal animal . 7 . the intraperitoneal lysis be apparently due to specific change in the fix peritoneal cell of tuberculous to normal animal . 
we aim to determine in what particular the blood be alter during tetany so that it can produce hyperexcitability of the motor nerve have be we aim to determine in what particular the blood be alter during tetany so that we aim to determine in what particular the blood be alter during tetany so that it can produce hyperexcitability of the motor nerve can produce the hyperexcitability . as a work hypothesis a work hypothesis have be assume that -lrb- 1 -rrb- there may be a lack of calcium in the blood and tissue ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- there may be a circulate poison which like a oxalate could render inactive the circulate calcium ; and -lrb- 3 -rrb- there may be a substance in circulation vaguely resemble strychnium in 3 action upon the nervous system and directly cause the hyperexcitability . it be impossible to decide with the true one , if any , of these explanation be the true one , but certain experimental result be bring forward . if tetany blood be use to perfuse a normal leg the excitability of   the hyperexcitability rise to a characteristically high level and the addition of parathyroid extract to the blood have little or no effect in lower the excitability of    the hyperexcitability . parathyroid extract whether from the ox or the dog fail when inject into the circulation of a animal in tetany to reduce the excitability of    the hyperexcitability markedly or permanently , although it seem to affect the more sensitive ganglion cell thus cut off excessive impulse to the periphery . although   the hyperexcitability remain hyperexcitable , tetany be usually much diminish or abolish entirely . this seem to be analogous to the action of ether or any other anesthetic which may inhibit the activity of the more sensitive ganglion cell , although this leave   the hyperexcitability excitable and able to conduct excessive impulse to the periphery . a animal in tetany relax instantly on be give ether although the excitability of the nerve to electric current be little change . bleed follow by the replacement of the blood with a indifferent solution free from calcium stop tetany and lower the excitability of    the hyperexcitability . probably this can not be ascribe to the removal of a circulate poison , but rather to a general disturbance of the nutrition of the nervous system . oxalate-like substance introduce into the circulation of a animal in tetany rapidly , and for a short time only , may kill a animal in tetany , but they seem to produce no change in the excitability of    the hyperexcitability . if a indifferent solution free from calcium be inject very slowly and over a long period the protective action of the body seem to be overcome and the excitability of    the hyperexcitability rise to high level . this seem to resemble somewhat the latent period after the destruction of the parathyroid before tetany begin . direct analysis of the blood show that as compare with the normal , the blood of a animal in tetany be very poor in calcium . administration of parathyroid extract do not increase this calcium content . on the contrary , if the extirpation of the parathyroid have be incomplete so that tetany do not appear , the calcium content of the blood be that of the normal animal . even yet , therefore , in spite of we effort to shake the contrary , the theory that tetany be closely dependent upon a disturbance of the calcium content of  the blood be support by stronger evidence than any other idea , but much remain to be do before a clear conception of the process be reach . 
a spontaneous chicken sarcoma , peculiarly fissured by blood sinus , and with a tendency to intracanalicular extension into they , have be transplant and study in eight successive group of fowl . Histologically no growth like it be Histologically the growth , while in Histologically the growth transfer to new host a real transplantation be obviously involve . the development of the first few series of transplantation tumor be very slow . they exhibit the histological structure of the original growth and have the same tendency to metastasize to the skeletal muscle . recently the tumor have grow more rapidly and in a higher percentage of new host . with this have come a simplification of structure to that of a pure , spindle-celled sarcoma . fowl of a alien variety -lrb- Plymouth Rock -rrb- form quite as good host for the tumor as those of the sort -lrb- brown Leghorn -rrb- in which a alien variety -lrb- Plymouth Rock -rrb- be originally find . a alien variety -lrb- Plymouth Rock -rrb- have not grow in pigeon , rat , or mouse . the question of the cause of the tumor be not take up in the present paper . the question of the cause of  the tumor have be find to be due to a agent which will pass through Berkefeld filter . no growth like it be quite distinct in no growth like it character from the other two transplantable neoplasm of the fowl -lrb- a pure , spindle-celled sarcoma a pure , spindle-celled sarcoma -rrb- which have such a cause . no growth like no growth like it have be observe among the forty-three spontaneous tumor of the fowl that have come under we observation . 
in the splenectornize dog the anemia cause by hemolytic poison -lrb- hemolytic immune serum and sodium oleate -rrb- and by bleeding be of a severer grade , run a longer course , and be accompany by a less rapid regeneration of the blood than be the case in the normal dog . also in the splenectomize dog , especially after the use of hemolytic serum , the leucocytosis be greater than in the normal animal . the splenectomize dog , especially after the use of hemolytic serum exhibit a increase resistance of the red cell to hypotonic salt solution , but after the administration of hemolytic poison -lrb- hemolytic immune serum and sodium oleate -rrb- , and especially hemolytic serum , this increase resistance disappear and a decrease resistance persist for long period of time . the same change occur in the normal dog , but in the latter the return to the previous degree of resistance be more rapid than in the splenectomize animal . 
the repeat injection of small dose of horse serum and egg-white in dog , cat , rabbit , and guinea pig that have be sensitize to these protein , cause injury to the cell of various organ and tissue with result inflammatory reaction . the change be especially mark after intraperitoneal injection in the peritoneum and after intravenous injection in the liver of rabbit and cat , and in the myocardium and kidney of all group of animal . in dog and rabbit , especially , there develop a well marked nephritis characterize by degeneration and necrosis of the epithelium of the loop of Henle , of the collect tubule , and less frequently of the convoluted tubule . this be accompany by a extensive small round cell infiltration of the interstitial tissue and later the formation of connective tissue . together with the change there be acute and chronic alteration in the glomerulus of all group of animal . egg-white in large dose be egg-white in large dose injurious to the kidney of animal , but this slight primary toxicity be probably greatly enhance through previous sensitization of the animal . 
the tumultuous auricular activity which follow faradization of the auricle of mammal and which have be variously describe , could be distinctly see to consist almost constantly in we experiment on dog of true fibrillatory movement of the separate muscle fiber coëxisting with a rapid auricular tachycardia . during peripheral stimulation of the right vagus nerve the true fibrillation alone exist , a rapid auricular tachycardia be inhibit . a comparison of the electrocardiogram from dog with this abnormal auricular activity with those from patient with the type of cardiac arhythmium which have be attribute to auricular fibrillation , and from patient with so call auricular flutter usually , indicate that the auricular activity in patient with either of these condition differ somewhat from the type of cardiac arhythmium usually see in the faradize auricle of the dog in we we experiment . the auricular activity of the case of cardiac arhythmium be apparently true fibrillation , similar to that see in the faradize the dog in we we experiment during right vagus stimulation . the electrocardiogram from case of so call auricular flutter usually give no evidence of auricular fibrillation , and the auricular activity of the case of cardiac arhythmium seem to consist of tachycardia alone . fibrillation may apparently coëxist with the tachycardia in some case , when the auricular activity of the case of cardiac arhythmium seem to resemble closely that usually see in the dog in we we experiment after auricular faradization . during peripheral stimulation of the left vagus nerve , the electrocardiogram from case of so call auricular flutter usually obtain after auricular faradization show change which render the electrocardiogram from case of so call auricular flutter usually more nearly similar to those obtain from patient with so call auricular flutter , indicate that the auricular activity in patient with either of these condition differ somewhat from the type of cardiac arhythmium . the fact that the auricular activity of the faradize    the dog in we we experiment during right vagus stimulation may apparently pass spontaneously into the dog in we we experiment closely resemble auricular flutter in man , that the auricular activity of      the faradize    the dog in we we experiment during right vagus stimulation may be change into true fibrillation by right vagus stimulation , and that the abnormal auricular activity in man pass from a state of flutter to that of fibrillation in a similar manner , may be take as evidence for the belief that auricular fibrillation and auricular flutter in man be closely ally cardiac disorder . 
the effect of inject morphin in right vagus dog be to slow or practically to stop auricular systole , the circulation be maintain by ectopic , independent , ventricular contraction . the function of conduction be , relatively speak , undisturbed . the fact that after morphin injection there be little or no disturbance of conduction in right vagus dog and a profound one in left vagus dog may be use as a factor in distinguish between auricular systole , especially when there be a reduction in rate greater than usual in left vagus dog . the effect on left vagus dog be to slow the rate of the auricle moderately and to increase the length of conduction , so that partial auriculoventricular block or complete auriculoventricular dissociation result . the result that have be obtain by faradic stimulation of one vagus nerve , the other be divide be precisely the result that have be obtain by faradic stimulation of one vagus nerve , one vagus nerve . there be slight difference in the result obtain between the two method , but the explanation for the result that have be obtain by faradic stimulation of one vagus nerve , the other be divide be probably to be find in the difference in the nature of the experiment . when faradic stimulation be employ , the stimulus be apply a short time only,-in we experiment for period not longer than ten seconds . the occurrence of the maximum effect be sudden and do not provide for a gradual introduction of the ventricle to new condition . in right vagus stimulation the ventricle usually stop beat . a gradual introduction be , however , not always necessary , as may be see in figure 5 and 6 of the paper -lrb- 4 -rrb- already quote , where idioventricular rhythm begin without delay . another difference between the two method be find in the degree of effect produce on stimulate the left vagus ; in the faradic method the change in conduction vary from mere lengthen to a condition so profound that complete auriculoventricular dissociation result ; these degree have be describe . the morphin method usually produce only incomplete dissociation . twice only be complete dissociation produce . the similarity between the result of the two method be sufficiently close to render the similarity between the result of   the two method likely that in obtain only incomplete dissociation a identical mechanism in the heart be involve . it may , therefore , be conclude that the inconstant action of the vagus result from morphin injection , call `` ungleichartig '' by Einthoven and Wieringa , appear so on account of the fact that after morphin injection there be little that the predominate effect of morphin may be exercise now on one and now on the opposite cardio-inhibitory system , and not , as be suggest , on account of a shift of predominance from one to another of the fiber tract in the vagus Einthoven and Wieringa . the explanation for the result that have be obtain by faradic stimulation of one vagus nerve , the other be divide offer as the result of this series of only,-in we experiment for period not longer than ten seconds differ from Einthoven and Wieringa . the result obtain between the two method substantiate the conclusion reach in the former series , that the two vagus act differently . a fact relate to the mechanism of the right vagus nerve can now be add , from a consideration of the cardiac mechanism in right vagus dog , namely , that derangement in conduction result , to a very slight extent only , as the effect of the influence of the right vagus nerve although no solution of the production of the extreme grade of sinus irregularity see in morphin intoxication be offer , the failure of this rhythm to be convert into a more profound irregularity may be explain . there seem little doubt that the occasion for the occurrence of a independent ventricular rhythm in only,-in we experiment for period not longer than ten seconds be due to the slowness of the auricular rate result from morphin injection . but in the case of sinus irregularity -lrb- no. 683 , 685 , and 700 -rrb- , the auricle be never sufficiently low for the ventricle to initiate a independent rhythm . 66.3 -lrb- no. 683 -rrb- be 66.3 -lrb- no. 683 -rrb- , and it appear that before a independent ventricular rhythm occur in any of the experiment , the auricular rate result from morphin injection have always fall below 41 -lrb- no. 686 , 688 , 697 , 698 , 706 , 715 , and 721 -rrb- . on the other hand , the ventricular rate in sinus irregularity -lrb- no. 683 , 685 , and 700 -rrb- be higher than the highest idioventricular rate observe and no advantage 
specimen of human blood take during the paralytic stage of experimental poliomyelitis and post mortem have prove not to be capable of infect Macacus monkey . specimen of monkey blood take at various stage of experimental poliomyelitis have not prove as a rule to be capable of infect Macacus monkey . in a single instance , among ten test , infection be secure with a specimen of blood remove at the beginning of the paralysis on the seventh day follow a intracerebral inoculation . when suspension of the spinal cord from a paralyzed monkey have be inject into the brain or simultaneously into the brain and spinal canal , the blood remove from one to forty-eight hour later fail to cause paralysis after intracerebral injection . when large volume of active filtrate be inject into the circulation the blood that paralysis result remain infective for seventy-two hour at least , but may be no longer infective after ten day when the paralytic symptom first appear . when , however , the filtrate be inject in smaller amount or when a filtrate of a less active virus be employ in large quantity , the blood that paralysis result either fail to convey infection or convey the filtrate irregularly . the filtrate be only when overwhelming quantity of a active virus be inject into the blood that paralysis result . the injection of moderate dose be not follow by paralysis , although a active virus may still be detect in a blood sample twenty-four hour after the injection of moderate dose . the existence of a mechanism capable of exclude a active virus within the blood from the central nervous organ be therefore infer . infection be accomplish far less readily through the circulation than by means of the more direct lymphatic and nervous channel of communication with the central nervous system . several series of feed experiment conduct with the bite stable fly -lrb- stomoxys calcitrans -rrb- result negatively . 
1 . sodium soap prepare from olive oil , croton oil , croton oil , linseed oil , etc. , have the property of inhibit the action of trypsin and leucoprotease . 2 . the activity of sodium soap prepare from olive oil be dependent upon the degree of unsaturation of the fatty acid and be in proportion to they iodin value . 3 . saturation of the acid with a halogen -lrb- iodin -rrb- cause a loss of the property of inhibit the action of trypsin and leucoprotease . 4 . soap of the saturated fatty acid test do not have this influence on ferment . 
1 . tubercle bacillus contain unsaturated fatty acid which , when saponify , have the property of inhibit the action of trypsin and leucoprotease . 2 . in proportion to they iodin value these soap be more active as inhibit agent than the soap prepare from linseed , olive , and cod-liver oils . 3 . the activity of these soap be dependent on the presence of unsaturated carbon bond . 4 . saturation of the soap with iodin destroy they inhibit action . 5 . the soap with iodin probably play a important part in the production of the condition know as caseation in tuberculosis . 
these study , like all study of the kidney , be difficult of interpretation because of the impossibility of produce a pure glomerular or pure tubular nephritis . arsenic nephritis in the kidney early stage be physiologically a vascular nephritis , but anatomically tubular , and show in the kidney early stage almost no retention of nitrogen , although study of urinary nitrogen indicate a increase catabolism . on the other hand , diphtheria nephritis in the early stage be anatomically diphtheria nephritis in the early stage with marked involvement of the glomerulus anatomically , but the other hand be physiologically the other hand , and in the kidney early stage there be little or almost no retention of nitrogen , although study of urinary nitrogen indicate a increase catabolism although study of metabolism indicate that protein catabolism be increase by the administration of diphtheria toxin . in both case , however , there appear to come a time when the excrete power of the kidney be exhaust and nitrogen accumulation occur in the blood . no argument for the influence of the tubule in the excretion of waste nitrogen be much less marked in the arsenic nephritis , with less tubular change , than in diphtheria toxin nephritis with no argument for the influence of the tubule in the excretion of waste nitrogen marked tubular degeneration . this same late accumulation of blood nitrogen be see in immune serum nephritis , where the tubular change be persistent and relatively more severe than the glomerular change . it might well be say that no argument for the influence of the tubule in the excretion of waste nitrogen be no argument for the influence of the tubule in the excretion of waste nitrogen because of the general exhaustion of the organism as a whole and of the kidney in particular , and that no positive conclusion can be draw be indicate by the opening sentence of this summary . tartrate nephritis be at first consider as purely tubular ; but the appearance of occasional glomerular change , as mention by Wells in one of he animal , and the fact that the presence of precipitated albumen in the subcapsular space , point out by Pearce and Ringer , probably indicate a increase permeability of the tuft capillary , all lead to the conclusion that although less tubular change predominate , there be , possibly , slight alteration of the glomerulus . this form of nephritis show the most marked retention of nitrogen , persist even though the glomerulus show less tubular change , tend to clear up with the progress of a time and evidently also with the repair of less tubular change , and bear a direct relation to the dose of tartaric acid and presumably with the degree of tubular change . it must be remember , however , that a very severe form be a very severe form , and this again cloud the physiological interpretation of the result . the study show no reason for alter the conclusion of we earlier study , but from the interpretation accord above it appear to throw more stress on tubular change as determine the most marked retention of nitrogen . the study confirm in addition the value of the method use for study of this type . 
it be possible by means of repeat injection of uranium nitrate to produce in the cat a subacute or chronic nephritis which can progress to a fatal termination and show in it course increase accumulation of non-protein nitrogen in the blood . a subacute or chronic nephritis which can progress to a fatal termination and show in it course increase accumulation of non-protein nitrogen in the blood differ only slightly from the spontaneous chronic nephritis of the species . repeated dose of diphtheria toxin produce a subacute form of nephritis with only temporary or slight retention , but nevertheless anatomically a well define nephritis . the spontaneous nephritis study resemble more closely that produce by uranium nitrate than uranium nitrate produce by diphtheria toxin both histologically and from the standpoint of blood analysis . 
1 . the plasma of guinea pig treat by injection of rat sarcoma exhibit a toxic action in tissue culture preparation on the cell of both rat sarcoma and rat embryo skin . similarly , the plasma of guinea pig immunize by injection of both rat sarcoma and rat embryo skin be toxic for cell of both type . 2 . injection of rat blood immunize against both sarcoma and embryo skin , although not so strongly as injection of the two tissue . 3 . Guinea pig receive injection of either chick embryo heart or intestine develop cytotoxic substance for both of the two tissue . 4 . the precede finding tend to show that cytotoxin form after the injection of different body tissue into a foreign species be to no extent specific for the tissue inject . 
in we study of the histogenesis of the miliary tubercle develop inside the liver lobule in animal that have be stain vitally while inoculate with bovine tuberculosis , the control enable we to recognize the manner in which the vital stain affect the liver . there be therefore no possibility of confuse the effect of the due to the organism with the effect due to the dye . no possibility of confuse the effect due to the organism with the effect due to the dye be , however , of interest to note that the effect of the be closely related . the vital stain alone be able to produce gradually some of the same change that occur with far greater rapidity in experimental tuberculosis . although in a few hour the kupffer cell of tuberculous animal begin to react to the disease , in the case of normal animal stain vitally some of the same change that occur with far greater rapidity in experimental tuberculosis do not do this until after the third or fourth dose of successive daily injection . after many day , nevertheless , the vital stain alone produce enlargement , proliferation , and separation of in a few hour the kupffer cell of tuberculous animal so that the gigantic macrophage of chronically stain animal be convert into large free phagocyte which may possess one or several nucleus . the gigantic macrophage of chronically stain animal be the gigantic macrophage of chronically stain animal . in all we experiment we have use only acutely stain animal that have be stain vitally while inoculate with bovine tuberculosis , so that the effect of the dye the be never sufficient to produce the same change that occur with far greater rapidity in experimental tuberculosis . in fact there be no evidence that the dye accentuate the same change that occur with far greater rapidity in experimental tuberculosis appreciably during the time involve in the experiment . the dye , however , show we the type of the cell enter into the tuberculous granuloma , for when feed to the body fluid in abundance trypan blue find the body way into all cell capable of receive the body . the vital stain be , as the vital be , a physiological test for the cell enter into the tuberculous granuloma , for when feed to the body fluid in abundance trypan blue find its way into all cell capable of receive it . whatever the fundamental nature of the vital stain produce by trypan blue and the benzidine dye may be , it be important that this reaction do not occur to any appreciable extent with mononuclear blood cell , and that this reaction do occur emphatically in the case of the hepatic endothelium . by means of this vital test , then , the follow phenomenon occur when suspension of tubercle bacillus be let into the portal blood stream . the organism , sweep on by the portal blood stream , finally lodge in the terminal branch of the portal vein , where they plug the vessel and continue to multiply . they injure the vessel wall and cause around they a exudative inflammatory process , and finally lead to the formation of tubercle situate not only in these area but also within the liver lobule in animal that have be stain vitally while inoculate with bovine tuberculosis . the injury to the vessel wall be manifest in the early stage by the presence of vitally stain area in the injury to   the vessel wall structure . the bacterium at the end of half a hour be find to be extracellular in clump in the larger vessel , but already to some extent in the body of vitally stain in a few hour the kupffer cell of tuberculous animal throughout the liver . exudative inflammation manifest the end of half a hour by the presence of a transitory accumulation of polynuclear leucocyte about the bacterial clump , which may be see as early as half a hour after the inoculation . they continue to be present in the larger cell clump of the periportal area for many day , but they be rapidly replace by other cell , mononuclear in type , so that within a day the histological appearance of the portal plug have change radically . the mononuclear cell thus enter most actively into this reaction be endothelial and not hematogenous in origin , the vital stain enable we to make a clear distinction . this fact , evident in the portal plug , be decisively show in the case of tubercle develop within the liver lobule in animal that have be stain vitally while inoculate with bovine tuberculosis . such tubercle probably result from the localization of individual organism within in a few hour the kupffer cell of tuberculous animal , for the initial stage of such a probable cycle have be find by we . they consist of the occurrence of mitosis in certain kupffer cell where the ziehl-nielson method show a bacillus or several bacillus to have be phagocytize -lrb- figure 4 -rrb- . rapid growth of the infected cell now take place , and at thirty-six hour the multinucleated giant cell produce be largely separate from the other endothelium of the vessel wall . many bacillus exist within the protoplasm of these cell -lrb- fus 
1 . the action of indophenoloxydase be generally diminish in the tissue -lrb- liver , renal cortex , the heart muscle -rrb- of rabbit that die of pneumococcus septicemia . the diminution be more frequent and marked in the liver and kidney than in the heart muscle . 2 . the diminish activity of indophenoloxydase become more evident when the tissue -lrb- liver , renal cortex , heart muscle -rrb- of rabbit that die of pneumococcus septicemia undergo autolysis . at 37 degree c. this ferment be much more easily destroy in the tissue of the infected animal than in those from normal control animal -lrb- table I , ii , iii , and iv -rrb- . exception be rare and those from normal control animal -lrb- table I , ii , iii , and iv -rrb- occur chiefly with the heart muscle . 3 . normal rabbit tissue , inoculate in vitro with pneumococcus culture , do not lose those from normal control animal -lrb- table I , ii , iii , and iv -rrb- indophenoloxydase much more quickly than do the normal control , when those from normal control animal -lrb- table I , ii , iii , and iv -rrb- be keep either at room temperature or at 37 degree c. -lrb- table I , ii , iii , and iv , v , VI , and vii -rrb- . 4 . it be therefore probable that the diminish activity of the indophenoloxydase of these tissue be not due to the presence of the pneumococcus in these tissue , but that the diminish activity of the indophenoloxydase of tissue from    pneumococcus septicemia be associate with a pathological change in the animal cell during life . 
liver.-the amount of filterable nitrogen in the sample before autolysis be too variable , both in the normal liver and in the liver from pneumococcus infection in the rabbit , for a constant difference to be obtain . the amino nitrogen before autolysis be generally slightly increase in the liver of the infected animal , especially in the perfused specimen . most of the experiment show a increase disintegration of the infected animal during the first stage of proteolysis -lrb- twenty to thirty hour -rrb- , both in the non-perfused and the perfused specimen . this increase disintegration be generally more evident for the complex protein -lrb- filterable nitrogen -rrb- than for the lower product -lrb- the amino nitrogen before autolysis -rrb- . in the later stage the proteolysis of the blood-containing liver of the normal and the infected rabbit tend to a equalization , or the relation reverse , the proteolysis of the normal sample become more advanced . in the perfused specimen the difference in the rate of proteolysis be the difference in the rate of proteolysis as in the earlier stage . kidney.-the rate of proteolysis show no constant difference in the normal and infected tissue . 
it have be show that white rat may survive complete extirpation of the thymus for at least 131 day , even when the operation be perform within the first two week of life . the removal of  the thymus for at least 131 day do not produce a arrest or retardation of body growth and development . qualitative change in the skeletal system or tooth have not be find . in emaciated , weak animal osteogenesis be less active than in healthy rat , and the long bone be smaller and more delicate in structure . such quantitative difference appear to depend upon the general nutrition , be equally pronounced in rat whose development be retard from other cause , and can not be refer specifically to loss of thymus function . no constant or characteristic alteration be detect in the spleen , testis , adrenal , or thyroid . whatever functional correlation may exist between the thymus for at least 131 day or all of these organ be not evident from the occurrence of histological change after the removal of the thymus for at least 131 day . the relative proportion of lymphocyte in the blood be diminish for the first few week after the operation . we have not determine how long this alteration in the leucocytic formulum persist . since this paper go to press a article have appear by Klose 's , describe briefly the result of thymus extirpation in pig , goat , rat , and chicken . in rat thymectomize on the fourteenth day , there follow a progressive cachexium terminate in death after eight to ten week . disturbance in ossification , which macroscopically and microscopically be identical with those of human rickets , develop also in the rib and the long bone . some of Klose 's litter fail to show these lesion , and this negative result be explain as have be due to the presence of thymic tissue within the thyroid gland . the observation of Klose 's be in direct contradiction to the negative result describe in this paper . since the possible presence of accessory thymus tissue either within the thyroid or elsewhere be carefully exclude in my experiment , the discrepancy between my finding and those of Klose 's can not be explain upon this basis . since this paper be send to the publisher my have study two additional rat which be kill 185 day after operation . minute examination of a complete series of the neck organ , include the thyroid , fail to show any tissue which could be interpret as thymus . the long bone show no rachitic change . the infective origin of rachitic and osteomalacic lesion in rat whose development be retard from other cause have be establish by Morpurgo 's . although reference be make by klose to Morpurgo 's work , the datum give by Morpurgo 's do not enable one to judge whether this infection be definitely exclude . 
we particularly interesting in the light of the fact experiment show that the albumen fraction , or end-piece , obtain by the dialysis of normal guinea pig serum possess definite opsonic action . this action be often almost equal to that reside in the unfractionated alexin . it be evident , however , only if the reaction maintain during we experiment approximate that of the original serum . by the addition of small quantity of a weak sodium hydrate solution to the dialyzed serum we particularly interesting in the light of the fact have be able to bring back opsonic action which be not evident in the same end-piece if simply render isotonic . although we particularly interesting in the light of the fact attention be call to the question of reaction by the work of Bronfenbrenner and Noguchi , like Liefmann , we particularly interesting in the light of the fact have be unable to reactivate the hemolytic function of the same end-piece by alteration of reaction . we particularly interesting in the light of the fact we experiment suggest that the opsonic action of the albumen fraction be enhance by preliminary sensitization of the bacterium with heated normal serum and by persensitization of such bacterium with the globulin fraction . however , we particularly interesting in the light of the fact can not be positive of this , since the slight difference of phagocytic count upon which such a opinion can be base , fall within the limit of what we particularly interesting in the light of the fact consider we particularly interesting in the light of the fact experimental error . the fact that the albumen fraction can exert opsonic activity upon the bacterium but can not hemolyze blood cell seem to we particularly interesting in the light of the fact that   the albumen fraction can exert opsonic activity upon the bacterium but can not hemolyze blood cell that alexin can be absorb by unsensitized bacterium but not by similarly untreated blood cell . the literature upon the relation of the alexin fraction to the bacterium and the bactericidal effect be confuse in that contradictory result have be obtain by other worker . we particularly interesting in the light of the fact be study this phase of the problem with particular attention to the alkalinity or acidity under which the reaction be carry out . we particularly interesting in the light of the fact think that we particularly interesting in the light of the fact we experiment do not point to a differentiation of normal opsonin from alexin , but we particularly interesting in the light of the fact believe other worker indicate that the so call end-piece can enter to a slight extent into non-specific relationship with unsensitized bacterium , and it be therefore active , whereas the so call end-piece can not enter into a similar relation to unsensitized cell . this conception , however , be tentatively make , since we particularly interesting in the light of the fact be study further the non-specific absorption of alexin or complement by unsensitized bacterium . 
a strain of spirochoeta pallida isolate from the nervous system have show the follow constant character : -lrb- 1 -rrb- thick form ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- the production of hard , well demarcated lesion with necrotic center ; -lrb- 3 -rrb- a characteristic location of the lesion ; -lrb- 4 -rrb- a short incubation period ; -lrb- 5 -rrb- a tendency to generalize with lesion of the skin and eye , follow local inoculation of the testicle and scrotum . it be suggest that the follow constant character : -lrb- 1 -rrb- thick form ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- the production of hard , well demarcated lesion with necrotic center ; -lrb- 3 -rrb- a characteristic location of the lesion ; -lrb- 4 -rrb- a short incubation period ; -lrb- 5 -rrb- constitute a definite strain of highly invasive power and that a classification of member of the pallida group may be make in accordance with highly invasive power . 
nitrous oxide , administer by means of the Gatch apparatus , as a preliminary anesthetic to ether have be find to be superior for the dog in rapidity of action , in promotion of ease of handling , and in absence of disorder ; the anesthesia may be maintain solely by nitrous oxide in combination with oxygen ; the Gatch apparatus be economical ; and the Gatch apparatus use be instructive to student from closer imitation of current surgical method . 
1 . caseous matter obtain from lymph gland which have not become secondarily infected contain these substance . these substance consist chiefly of the soap . 2 . the inhibit substance be present in relatively smaller amount when the caseous matter have become secondarily infect . this be probably due to the dilution and wash out of the soap . 3 . the ferment be either entirely absent or present in very small amount , unless the caseous matter have become secondarily infect . 4 . caseous material from the lung contain smaller amount of the inhibit substance . this may be due to the acuteness of the process , which do not permit a accumulation of the soap , or to the binding of the soap with the ferment . 5 . the ferment be present in caseous pneumonia . in the whole emulsion the ferment be less active in a alkaline than in a acid reaction ; but removal of the soap show that those active in a alkaline reaction be also present in considerable amount . 6 . the previous treatment with iodin of caseous matter from both lymph gland and lung increase the action of the trypsin . 
1 . dilution of plasma with isotonic solution cause a more extensive migration in culture of cell of the actively migratory type , such as those of spleen and bone marrow . dilution with a limited quantity of distilled water produce the same effect . less actively motile cell be influence little or not at all by dilution . the effect on the cell be probably due to the reduction in the quantity of fibrin in the clot produce lessened resistance to cell locomotion . 2 . dilution of plasma with either isotonic solution or distilled water be without effect on cell multiplication , as be show by record of the number of mitosis in live culture preparation . 3 . dilution of plasma with suitable quantity of Ringer 's solution cause a marked diminution in the quantity of fat accumulate by the cell . the reduction in the quantity of fibrin in the clot be to be attribute to the decrease in the quantity of fat accumulate by the cell in the medium . the accumulation of the fat be therefore not to be regard as the result of a cell degeneration , but as the accumulation of     the fat , the accumulation of     the fat be the medium in which the cell be grow . 
1 . some strain of trypanosoma lewisus may , at time , produce rapidly fatal infection in a large percentage of the rat infect . 2 . in such strain of trypanosoma lewisus , a sufficient degree of pathogenicity may persist to warrant the designation of such strain of  trypanosoma lewisus as pathogenic . 3 . the pathogenicity of a give strain of trypanosoma lewisus be not constant , but be subject to marked and even sudden variation . 
the virus of epidemic poliomyelitis introduce into the blood may pass indirectly by way of the cerebrospinal fluid to the interstice of the central nervous organ . to reach the cerebrospinal fluid the virus of poliomyelitis must first penetrate the barrier of the choroid plexus , which operation require time . by the inoculation test , the virus of poliomyelitis be detect in the fluid at the expiration of 48 hour , only small amount at the expiration of 72 hour , while at the expiration of 96 hour the virus of poliomyelitis have pass more freely . the virus of poliomyelitis be still detectable in the fluid at the onset of paralysis 19 day after the intravenous injection . pathological condition of the leptomeninge and the cerebrospinal fluid play a important part in the pathogenesis of epidemic poliomyelitis . 
1 . in rheumatic myocarditis , focus , term the submiliary nodule of Aschoff , be present which be characteristic of the rheumatic infection . 2 . they be most frequently find in the wall of the left ventricle , the auricle usually escape . 3 . the submiliary nodule of Aschoff be find in three case of chorea without joint manifestation , prove the close relation of this condition to rheumatism . 4 . they be absent in fourteen case of subacute bacterial endocarditis due to streptococcus mitis . 5 . they be not find in infection of the endocardium with the gonococcus , staphylococcus , streptococcus , or pneumococcus . 6 . even in the absence of a rheumatic history we believe , in accordance with Fraenkel , that the presence of no aschoff body signify a previous rheumatic infection . 7 . no aschoff body be not always find in rheumatic carditis , where a previous rheumatic infection antedate death by a long period , but the heal remains , represent by sclerotic patch -lrb- `` Schwielen '' -rrb- , be present . 8 . we suggest that the case of arthritis characterize by the presence of the submiliary nodule of Aschoff in the myocardium be place in one group and call for the time be `` rheumatism '' ; and the case with articular manifestation , yield positive bacteriological finding and no aschoff body , should be classify accord to the infect microörganisms concern , and not as rheumatism . 
1 . by the intravenous injection into rabbit of streptococcus mitis , we have produce focalized myocardial lesion which be identical with those cause by the injection of streptococcus rheumaticus , and with those produce by bracht and wächter with streptococcus viridan . 2 . focalized myocardial lesion which be identical with those cause by the injection of streptococcus rheumaticus , and with those produce by bracht and wächter with streptococcus viridan differ from those which we produce by injection of the streptococcus from the Chicago epidemic of sore throat -lrb- epidemic streptococcus -rrb- . 3 . focalized myocardial lesion which be identical with those cause by the injection of streptococcus rheumaticus , and with those produce by bracht and wächter with streptococcus viridan be not identical with aschoff body and be easily differentiate from those which we produce by injection of streptococcus from the Chicago epidemic of sore throat -lrb- epidemic streptococcus -rrb- . those which we produce by injection of streptococcus from the Chicago epidemic of sore throat -lrb- epidemic streptococcus -rrb- also differ from the focus produce by Jackson and Coombs , who describe those which we produce by injection of streptococcus from the Chicago epidemic of sore throat -lrb- epidemic streptococcus -rrb- focalized myocardial lesion which be identical with those cause by the injection of streptococcus rheumaticus , and with those produce by bracht and wächter with streptococcus viridan as be either aschoff body or similar formation . 4 . the myocardial lesion of the rabbit appear to be cause by toxin liberate by the streptococcus inject and not by the living organism those which we produce by injection of streptococcus from the Chicago epidemic of sore throat -lrb- epidemic streptococcus -rrb- . 5 . the only point of similarity between the experimental lesion and those find in case of rheumatic carditis in man be those find in case of rheumatic carditis in man the only point of similarity between the experimental lesion and those find in case of rheumatic carditis in man . 
1 . we have produce arthritis in 50 per cent . of the rabbit inject with streptococcus mitis . 2 . the character of the arthritis be identical with that produce by micrococcus rheumaticus . 3 . the exudate in and about the joint partake of the same nature as 3 cause by streptococcus rheumaticus . 4 . bacteriological study show that streptococcus mitis can be recover from about one third of the affect joint . 5 . Arthritis produce by other type of streptococcus differ by reason of greater destruction of tissue , by be more permanent in character , and by the exudate contain large number of polymorphonuclear leucocyte . 6 . the deduction of a distinct variety or species of streptococcus base upon the power to cause arthritis in the rabbit inject with streptococcus mitis be unwarranted . 
1 . what appear to be certain definite stage in the malarial parasite from red corpuscle to red corpuscle to red corpuscle may be demonstrate by thorough and persistent observations,-not minute spend on each specimen , but many hour . 2 . the migration of the malarial parasite from red corpuscle to red corpuscle give a reasonable explanation of the loss of red corpuscle which can not be account for by the destruction of the infected corpuscle at the time the parasite segment . 3 . a satisfactory explanation of the ultimate fate of the young parasite see in instance of multiple infection of single corpuscle be a satisfactory explanation of the ultimate fate of the young parasite see in instance of multiple infection of single corpuscle . 4 . in the light of the fact here present , the light of the fact here present would seem impossible to explain the instance of the young parasite see in instance of multiple infection of single corpuscle partly on and partly off degenerate red corpuscle as the result of technique . a stage in the malarial parasite from red corpuscle to red corpuscle seem to I to be the probable interpretation of the phenomenon . 5 . a corpuscular mound encircle by a adult parasite , when see at the periphery of the red corpuscle , should have the same significance and interpretation in reference to the extracellular relation of the red corpuscle , that a adult parasite have when a adult parasite be see in connection with a young parasite . 6 . the adult ring-form parasite should have the same interpretation as the young ring-form parasite . 7 . attachment to the external surface of degenerate red corpuscle as the result of technique seem to I to be the only possible interpretation of the appearance of the parasite picture in this article . 
1 . the ferment-inhibiting action of the serum be due to the presence of compound of the unsaturated fatty acid . 2 . these fatty acid compound may be remove from the serum by means of chloroform or ether . 3 . soap prepare by saponify the chloroform or ether extract inhibit the action of trypsin . 4 . the anti-enzyme action of the serum can be remove by filter acid serum through kaolin , and can in part be restore by extract the kaolin . 5 . the decrease in strength of anti-enzyme in old serum be probably due to the action of the serum lipase . 6 . Iodin , potassium iodide , or hydrogen peroxide remove the inhibit action of the serum . 7 . soap of the unsaturated fatty acid lose Iodin , potassium iodide , or hydrogen peroxide the ferment-inhibiting action of the serum when heat with serum at 70 degree c. 
1 . Sera from which the protective lipoid -lrb- unsaturated fatty acid -rrb- have be remove be toxic for the homologous animal . 2 . the toxicity be due to three factor : -lrb- a -rrb- a alteration in the mechanism of coagulation , with result intravascular coagulation ; -lrb- b -rrb- the exposure of the native serum protein ; -lrb- c -rrb- the formation of toxic split product -lrb- primary proteose -rrb- by autolysis . 3 . a definite maximum of toxicity can be determine , with a final stage of atoxicity due to continued autolysis . 4 . hirudin and sodium citrate do not protect animal . 5 . heating to 70 degree c. destroy , or greatly lessen , the toxicity of the serotoxin , although the isolate proteose be toxic after boil . 6 . the return of the extract lipoid -lrb- saponify -rrb- neutralize the toxicity . 7 . Unsaturated soap also neutralize the toxicity . 8 . sublethal dose produce extreme prostration , marked fall in body temperature , marked fall in body temperature , and marked fall in body temperature . 9 . sublethal dose of rapidly prepare chloroform serum cause a decrease in coagulation time ; sublethal dose of autolyzed serum cause a increase in coagulation time . 10 . previously inject animal be more resistant -lrb- increase antiferment -rrb- . 11 . Iodized animal be less resistant -lrb- decrease antiferment -rrb- . 
several green dye show a marked selective action for member of the typhoid-paratyphoid-colon group . this can be use for the enrichment of typhoid and paratyphoid bacillus present in fece . forty dye be test with thirty strain cover all type of pathogenic bacterium . in general forty dye restrain the growth of the gram-positive bacterium but have no effect on the growth of the gram-negative group . 
it have be show that the chick embryo offer suitable condition for the growth of implant tissue , whether these be embryonic or adult , of the same species or a foreign one . the chick at about the time of hatch develop a defensive mechanism against the foreign tissue . this resistance can be supply to the embryo in the early stage if graft of adult spleen or bone marrow be implant . under suitable condition the embryo in the early stage exhibit the same resistance to foreign tissue as do the adult , and present the same histological manifestation about the graft . furthermore , the same tissue , spleen and bone marrow , when graft into a embryo with a established and grow rat tumor , bring about a retrogression and absorption of the foreign tissue . other adult tissue do not supply this power to the embryo in the early stage . 
1 . the malarial parasite be extracellular throughout the malarial parasite life cycle and migrate from red corpuscle to red corpuscle destroy each before the malarial parasite abandon the malarial parasite ; in the brief interval between , the parasite , all other form be assume in order to secure attachment and to obtain food be free in the blood serum , though under normal condition there be no reason why the malarial parasite should remain free for any length of time ; the malarial parasite do not remain long free , but almost immediately attach the malarial parasite to another red corpuscle by means of delicate pseudopodium . 2 . the compact form of the tertian parasite be the compact form of the tertian parasite ; in the compact form of the tertian parasite the parasite , all other form be assume in order to secure attachment and to obtain food may be see not only in migration , but after quinine and in the cadaver . I believe the compact form to be the normal rest form of the parasite , all other form be assume in order to secure attachment and to obtain food , all other form be assume in order to secure attachment and to obtain food . 3 . Care must be take not to confound free parasite have protoplasmic pseudopodium ready for attachment with the sexual flagellate parasite , whose flagellum be compose of chromatin . 4 . the malarial parasite can live for some time free in the blood serum , though under normal condition there be no reason why the malarial parasite should remain free for any length of time , though under normal condition there be no reason why the malarial parasite should remain free for any length of some time , and there be certain period in the life of another red corpuscle by means of delicate pseudopodium  the parasite , all other form be assume in order to secure attachment and to obtain food , all other form be assume in order to secure attachment and to obtain food . if  the parasite , all other form be assume in order to secure attachment and to obtain food , all other form be assume in order to secure attachment and to obtain food be , as I believe , attach to the external surface of another red corpuscle by means of delicate pseudopodium ,  the parasite , all other form be assume in order to secure attachment and to obtain food , all other form be assume in order to secure attachment and to obtain food be constantly expose to the action of the patient ' serum . 5 . the destruction of more than one red corpuscle by each parasite would readily account for the severe and early anemia occur in malarial infection . 6 . long continued treatment with quinine will eventually cause the death of all malarial parasite . 
the adrenalin index as use in this paper mean the amount of adrenalin in milligram per gram of gland . as in we hand the chemical colorimetric method have prove more accurate , these value rather than the physiological value will be give in the final analysis . the two adrenal gland in the same individual as a rule contain about the same amount of adrenalin per gram , but variation of 10 to 20 per cent . be not unusual . normal dog show a index which may vary from 1.2 to 1.8 milligram . normal dog be kill by short ether anesthesia and bleeding from the carotid . normal human being , die from trauma , rupture of aneurysm , etc. , show a index of 0.35 to 0.50 of a milligram , when autopsy take place a few hour after death . deterioration of uncut gland or of a gland hash keep on ice in the dark be not rapid and rarely exceed 10 per cent . in twenty-four hour . acute intoxication in normal dog show a low adrenalin index , a low adrenalin index . intravenous injection of the poison find in closed duodenal loop sufficient to cause fatal shock cause a great drop in the adrenalin index , which may be normal or slightly subnormal , at time to one fourth normal or even lower . after recovery from a sublethal toxic dose the adrenalin index , which may be normal or slightly subnormal may rise rapidly to a point considerably above normal . the same may hold for recovery after chloroform poisoning . anesthesia by chloroform or ether cause a drop in the adrenalin index , which may be normal or slightly subnormal depend upon the length of anesthesia and probably in part on the depth of anesthesia . liver poison -lrb- chloroform , phosphorus , hydrazine -rrb- cause a drop in the adrenal index to a low level , perhaps one half normal in acute case . pancreas extirpation with prolonged glycosurium and death produce a great drop in the adrenalin index -lrb- cat -rrb- . there be evidence that this may hold in some case of human diabetes . in man disease of one adrenal -lrb- tuberculosis -rrb- may be associate with a adrenalin index of double the normal value in the intact adrenal . pernicious anemia be the only disease so far find to present a abnormally high adrenalin index , and the single case show a index at least twice normal . this be of interest especially in relation to the view recently put forward to indicate that the spleen and adrenal -lrb- tuberculosis -rrb- may be concern in the lipoid metabolism which be think to be profoundly disturb in the only disease so far find to present a abnormally high adrenalin index . secondary anemia due to repeat hemorrhage or the intoxication of cancer or tuberculosis cause a fall in the adrenalin index , which may be normal or slightly subnormal . cachexium due to neoplasm or tuberculosis may cause a marked fall in the adrenalin index , which may be normal or slightly subnormal , perhaps to less than one half of normal . acute infection -lrb- typhoid fever -rrb- , acute infection -lrb- typhoid fever -rrb- may be associate with a normal adrenalin index or one somewhat below normal . disease of the kidney , heart , or blood vessel associate with elevated blood pressure show no constant variation in the adrenalin index , which may be normal or slightly subnormal , which may be normal or slightly subnormal . 
ovarian infection and germinal transmission of disease have be conclusively demonstrate in we investigation of bacillary white diarrhea in the common domestic fowl . the disease , which have cause so much loss to the poultry industry in recent year , which have cause so much loss to the poultry industry in recent year , primarily affect young chick that be but a few week old . chick which survive frequently become permanent the ovary be the important seat of infection , the ovary be the important seat of infection . the egg from such carrier often harbor the organism of the disease in the yolk . chick that develop in infected egg become in turn infected , and have the disease at the time of hatching .  the disease , which have cause so much loss to the poultry industry in recent year , which have cause so much loss to the poultry industry in recent year be transmit to normal chick through the infected dropping ; thus a epidemic be produce , and the cycle of infection be complete . there be no evidence to indicate that germinal transmission through the male take place . in view of the frequent negative result bear on this question it seem probable that view of the frequent negative result do not . 
1 . the morphological and developmental anomaly of a pathogenic strain of trypanosoma lewisus have be describe to show the unusual character of a pathogenic strain of trypanosoma lewisus . 2 . Especial attention be call to the spontaneous occurrence of ablepharoplastic form of trypanosoma lewisus . 3 . it be point out that the morphological and developmental anomaly of a pathogenic strain of trypanosoma lewisus be most pronounced in infection that show unusual condition of multiplication , and that such infection usually prove severe . 4 . finally , a appreciable correlation between the morphological and developmental characteristic and the virulence as manifest in these example of infection with trypanosoma lewisus have be suggest . 
two spontaneous chicken tumor , unlike in several important respects , have give rise on transplantation to neoplasm of identical character . a spindle-celled sarcoma rift with blood sinus into which it extend , with result in what may be describe as a intracanalicular pattern a spindle-celled sarcoma rift with blood sinus into which it extend , with result in what may be describe as a intracanalicular pattern a spindle-celled sarcoma rift with blood sinus into which it extend , with result in what may be describe as a intracanalicular pattern , be a spindle-celled sarcoma rift with blood sinus into which a spindle-celled sarcoma rift with blood sinus into which it extend , with result in what may be describe as a intracanalicular pattern extend , with result in what may be describe as a intracanalicular pattern . the metastase , which be in the voluntary muscle , show the same peculiar structure . a solid , spindle-celled sarcoma of rather close texture , occur in the subcutaneous tissue of the groin , be a solid , spindle-celled sarcoma of rather close texture , with few blood vessel . here and there be small area of softening , and at here center be a large degeneration cyst with ragged wall , contain a clear fluid . there be the metastase . the transplantation tumor from both growth have be characterize by slow growth , tendency to metastasize to the skeletal muscle without involvement of the lung , and a structure which at one time be that of a very regular spindle-celled sarcoma contain many band and ribbon of collagen , and at another that of a sarcoma rift with blood sinus like the spontaneous tumor no. 18 . at present the two strain be practically indistinguishable in appearance and general behavior . both be cause by filterable agent . the agent cause no. 38 , unlike 38 cause a spindle-celled sarcoma rift with blood sinus into which a spindle-celled sarcoma rift with blood sinus into which it extend , with result in what may be describe as a intracanalicular pattern extend , with result in what may be describe as a intracanalicular pattern , retain no. 38 activity in tumor tissue which have be dry or glycerinate ; and in a Berkefeld filtrate a Berkefeld be much the more active in cause the transplantation tumor from both growth . these difference can hardly be think of as constitute a fundamental distinction between agent which , to judge from both effect , be almost undoubtedly different strain of a single disease cause . that chicken tumor of markedly different type have different filterable agent as agent which , to judge from both effect a single disease cause have be prove by experiment already report . the present finding make that chicken tumor of markedly different type have different filterable agent as agent which , to judge from both effect a single disease cause have be prove by experiment probable that , within certain limit , tumor of rather various character may be dependent upon a single agent . this assumption greatly simplify the etiological problem . but the truth of the assumption for other instance than those describe in the present article can only be determine by the study and comparison in many host of the disease-complex of which each spontaneous chicken tumor be to be consider as a individual expression . 
cholera-like non-agglutinating vibrio be invariably find in the intestinal contents of healthy person , and frequently in the water of well and river , during epidemic of cholera . although many of these saprophytic vibrio be indistinguishable in morphology and cultural property from the cholera vibrio , the negative reaction with a anticholera serum have readily differentiate many of these saprophytic vibrio from the asiatic vibrio . the biological polymorphism of the cholera vibrio have be suggest by the development of agglutination , by special method of culture , in cholera-like vibrio which eventually develop agglutination property . Confirmatory Pfeiffer reaction have not be obtain , as a rule , in these instance , probably because of the low virulence of the vibrio culture , although positive bacteriolysis in vitro -lrb- Bordet 's test -rrb- be observe in some , and in other positive complement fixation and cross agglutination indicate the cholera nature of cholera-like vibrio which eventually develop agglutination property in question . although a rule can not as yet be definitely prove , we be justified in suspect that cholera-like vibrio which eventually develop agglutination property be of a true cholera nature . it be probable that the production of agglutination antibody in a anticholera serum bring about the development of agglutination by the bacterial cell of defensive anti-agglutinin , result in the disappearance of agglutinating power . in the case of the water vibrio , change physical condition could bring about a similar alteration in biological property . the case may be say that the absence of agglutination in a vibrio isolate from a suspect source do not define conclusively the absence of agglutination in a vibrio isolate from a suspect source noncholera nature . in all probability among a number of cholera-like vibrio isolate from suspect source a certain percentage will eventually be find to develop agglutination either during laboratory cultivation or by means of animal passage , and until subject to a procedure that will induce the return of agglutination a vibrio isolate from a suspect source can be regard with assurance as of a truly saprophytic variety . 
the parameningococcus of Dopter be culturally indistinguishable from true or normal meningococcus , but serologically true or normal meningococcus exhibit difference as regard agglutination , opsonization , and complement deviation . because of the variation and irregularity of serum reaction exist among otherwise normal strain of true or normal meningococcus of the variation and irregularity of serum reaction exist among otherwise normal strain of true or normal meningococcus do not seem either possible or desirable to separate the parameningococcus of Dopter into a strictly definite class . of the variation and irregularity of serum reaction exist among otherwise normal strain of true or normal meningococcus appear desirable to consider true or normal meningococcus as constitute a special strain among true or normal meningococcus , however , wholly consistent in a special strain . the distinction in serum reaction between normal and para meningococcus be support by the difference in protective effect of the monovalent immune serum upon infection in guinea pig and monkey . it be therefore conclude that it be highly desirable to employ strain of parameningococcus in the preparation of the usual polyvalent antimeningococcic serum . the preparation of the usual polyvalent antimeningococcic serum remain to be determine whether the preparation of the usual polyvalent antimeningococcic serum be better to employ the parameningococcus of Dopter along with normal meningococcus in immunize horse , or to employ normal and para strain separately in the immunization process and to combine afterwards , in certain proportion , the serum from the two kind of immunize immunize horse . 
the metabolism of calcium be study in a man after complete removal of the thyroid and parathyroid gland . a slight retention of calcium -lrb- 0.4578 of a gram of calcium oxide in the ten-day period -rrb- be note . the urinary calcium excretion be low , average 0.0134 of a gram per day on a daily ingestion average 1.6736 gram of calcium oxide in the ten-day period . a slight increase be observe during the period of study in the calcium content of the blood . no symptom of tetany be note in the patient , who survive operation thirty-nine day . the low urinary and blood calcium value be take to show deficient absorption of calcium , which may bear some relation to the decrease gastric secretion after parathyroidectomy . attempt be make to explain the non-occurrence of tetany as due to the high calcium intake and to the development of a compensatory mechanism in which the pituitary body may play a part . 
when these rabbit be inject intravenously with a quantity of virulent streptococcus or pneumococcus sufficient to cause death within two to four day the septicemia take a definite course with slight variation . the bacterium rapidly decrease in number from the time of the injection to from two to four hour , at which time the blood be sterile or contain only a few bacterium . within five to six hour the bacterium reappear in the blood and steadily increase until the death of the animal . if the bacterium be less virulent , the same quantity of culture cause a chronic type of infection . the same initial decrease in the number of bacterium occur . the reëntrance into the blood be somewhat delay , the septicemia do not reach the height obtain in the acute case , and a second fall occur within the course of a few hour . these rabbit show a low blood invasion or a sterile blood culture for several day . during the time of the injection to from two to four hour , at which time the blood be sterile or contain only a few bacterium they become emaciate to a marked degree . then the low septicemia rapidly rise or the rabbit with a sterile culture develop a severe septicemia within a few hour and death take place from a few hour to two to four day thereafter . in this type of infection local lesion , pericarditis , pleurisy , peritonitis , etc. , be usually find . in the infection which run a acute course no gross lesion be find . if the bacterium be still less virulent they never reënter the blood after the initial disappearance and these rabbit remain in good condition . in order to obtain uniform result , the quantity of bacterium inject must not be so large that the bacterial substance see pdf for structure carry in be sufficient to cause a intoxication of the animal . if the quantity of bacterium inject be below this point the course of the infection depend largely upon the virulence of the infect organism . yet variation in the natural resistance of individual animal may be sufficient to cause quite marked irregularity in the infection . Pneumococci can be standardized so as to produce a particular type of infection more easily than virulent streptococcus or pneumococcus sufficient to cause death within two to four day . in general infection such as those produce by streptococcus and pneumococcus the number of the bacterium present in the circulate blood at a give time supplies accurate and delicate information regard the severity of the disease . when the object be to determine the degree of virulence of bacterium inject , or of the efficiency of a experimental therapeutic method , the mere physical condition and mere death of the inoculate individual animal be not sufficient and satisfactory guide to the desire information . the death of the inoculate animal and the recovery of the infect bacterium at autopsy do not give complete information concern the intensity and course of the infection occur during life . a well know fact do not necessarily prove the existence of a heavy infection before the onset of the death agony , since a well know fact be a well know fact that bacterium inject multiply with enormous rapidity , once the natural resistance of the animal have be overcome . therefore , if merely the life and death of the animal and autopsy finding must serve as we only guide , we shall lose much incidental information , perhaps of fundamental value . this may be especially true as regard the search for curative substance . again , the individual animal of the same species , the same species the same species react to the aggressive force of the infect organism variously . a well know fact be readily find out by the injection of a series of these rabbit with lethal quantity of bacterium per body-weight , and by make test at various period before death result , which , in the case of virulent streptococcus or pneumococcus sufficient to cause death within two to four day , range from one to six day . consequently a method which enable the determination of the degree and progress of the infection at any desire period be of obvious advantage . 
the virus of epidemic poliomyelitis be capable of penetrate the retina without produce apparent injury , to reach the central nervous organ . the virus of poliomyelitis inject into the blood be deposit promptly in the spleen and bone marrow , but not in the kidney , spinal cord , or brain . notwithstanding the affinity which the nervous tissue possess for the virus of poliomyelitis , it be not remove from the blood be deposit promptly in the spleen and bone marrow , but not in the kidney , spinal cord , or brain by the spinal cord and brain until the choroid plexus and blood vessel have suffer injury . the intervertebral ganglion remove the virus from the blood be deposit promptly in the spleen and bone marrow , but not in the kidney , spinal cord , or brain earlier than do the spinal cord and brain . a aseptic inflammation produce by a intraspinous injection of horse serum facilitate and insure the passage of the virus to the central nervous organ , and the production of paralysis . the unaided virus , even when present in large amount , pass inconstantly from the blood to the substance of the spinal cord and brain . when the virus from  the blood be deposit promptly in the spleen and bone marrow , but not in the kidney , spinal cord , or brain fail to gain access to the central nervous organ , and to set up paralysis , the virus from  the blood be deposit promptly in the spleen and bone marrow , but not in the kidney , spinal cord , or brain be destroy by the body , in course of which destruction the virus from  the blood be deposit promptly in the spleen and bone marrow , but not in the kidney , spinal cord , or brain undergo , as a result of the action of the spleen and , perhaps , other organ , diminution of virulence . the histological lesion that follow the intravenous injection of the virus from  the blood be deposit promptly in the spleen and bone marrow , but not in the kidney , spinal cord , or brain but not in all case differ from those that arise from the intraneural method of infection in the monkey . in escape from the blood be deposit promptly in the spleen and bone marrow , but not in the kidney , spinal cord , or brain into the spinal cord the spinal cord and brain , the virus of poliomyelitis cause a lymphatic invasion of the choroid plexus and widespread perivascular infiltration , and from the latter cellular invasion enter the nervous tissue . a similar lymphoid infiltration of the choroid plexus may arise also from a intracerebral injection of the virus of poliomyelitis . the histological lesion present in the central nervous organ in human case of epidemic poliomyelitis correspond to those that arise from the intraneural method of infection in the monkey . the virus in transit from the blood through the cerebrospinal fluid to the substance of     the spinal cord and brain and brain be capable of be neutralize by intraspinous injection of immune serum , whereby the production of paralysis be avert . Carmin in a sterile and finely divide state introduce into the meninx and ventricle set up a aseptic inflammation , but be quickly take up by the ependymal cell . when a aseptic inflammation have be previously establish by means of horse serum , or when the nervous tissue be already injure by the poliomyelitic virus , the pigment appear to enter the ependymal cell more freely . the experiment describe support the view that infection in epidemic poliomyelitis in man be local and neural , and by way of the lymphatic , and not general and by way of the blood be deposit promptly in the spleen and bone marrow , but not in the kidney , spinal cord , or brain . hence they uphold the belief that the upper respiratory mucous membrane be the upper respiratory mucous membrane . 
the rise of temperature follow typhoid vaccination be accompany by a marked increase in the output of total nitrogen , creatinin , and especially of uric acid . the reaction to tuberculin be slower , but be also accompany by a increase output of nitrogenous substance , nitrogenous substance be , however , less uniform and generally less pronounced . in a case of malaria there be a tendency for the rise of temperature follow typhoid vaccination to be accompany by a increase output of total nitrogen and less uniformly of creatinin ; on two day on which the fever be precede by rigor the output of uric acid be increase . 
when phenoltetrachlorphthalein be inject intravenously , it be eliminate from the body in the bile through the activity of the hepatic epithelium . the fece may be collect after purgation and the phthalein extract and estimate against a standard solution . the estimation of phthalein can be do with accuracy in a suitable colorimeter and the elimination in normal dog be quite constant . give a definite liver injury by means of poison -lrb- chloroform , phosphorus -rrb- , the amount of phthalein excrete will be diminish and the fall in output will be proportional to the amount of injury . with a acute fatal poisoning the curve , follow by a return to normal and a final drop in the last few day before death may fall to zero . under certain condition of vascular interference the liver phthalein may show a decrease output ; in passive congestion of the liver and with the eck fistula the liver output may fall considerably below normal . know disturbance of the liver function due to parenchymatous injury or vascular disturbance be indicate by a fall in the liver phthalein . excretion curve . conversely it may be claim that a drop in phthalein excretion may indicate a decrease in the functional capacity of the liver even if there be no detectable histological change . adrenal insufficiency produce by extirpation of three fourth or more of the gland tissue will be associate with a drop in liver phthalein excretion . with hypertrophy of the adrenal fragment liver phthalein excretion come back to normal , but may fall again when more adrenal tissue be remove -lrb- text-figure 1 -rrb- . pancreatic insufficiency cause a progressive fall in the phthalein excretion indicate a grave lowering of the functional capacity of the liver -lrb- text-figure 2 -rrb- . this fact have a direct bearing on the question of diabetes . parathyroid insufficiency with tetany cause a decrease in phthalein output , but at time a rise above normal . this come out best when the phthalein curve be low follow pancreas extirpation . parathyroid tetany may cause hyperactivity on the part of the liver cell . thyroid insufficiency produce no change in the uniform curve of phthalein excretion . hypophysis insufficiency show a initial fall in the curve , follow by a return to normal and a final drop in the last few day before death , follow by a return to normal and a final drop in the last few day before death . these experiment supply evidence to the effect that the liver be very much concern in the derangement that follow the removal of the ductless gland . hence it seem probable that a important factor in the general symptom complex of ductless gland insufficiency may be a important factor in the general symptom complex of ductless gland insufficiency . in conclusion we wish to express we appreciation to Dr. S. J. Crowe and Dr. A. P. Jones for assistance render in perform some of the operation for gland removal . 
1 . there be no demonstrable increase in non-coagulable nitrogen during bacteriolysis . 2 . bacterium treat with immune serum and complement be so altered that they be more readily digest by trypsin . 3 . bacterium treat with immune serum and complement become more resistant to proteolysis . 4 . bacterium treat with a excess of immune serum and complement become more resistant to proteolysis . 
a comparison of the result obtain in the analysis of the different effusion show that the different effusion vary , -lrb- 1 -rrb- accord to location , and -lrb- 2 -rrb- accord to the disease in which the different effusion be produce . thus the subcutaneous effusion be totally different in the subcutaneous effusion composition from the abdominal or pleuritic fluid ; and again the abdominal fluid of nephritic origin be different from those of cardiac or other origin . the cutaneous effusion be characterize by a very low protein content and a small amount of incoagulable nitrogen . of the protein present in the abdominal or pleuritic fluid , the globulin constitute the greater portion . in the mixed cardionephritic fluid the ratio of globulin to albumin be lower than that in normal blood serum ; but when compare with the blood serum of cardionephritic case there appear to be a certain parallelism . the chloride content of the abdominal or pleuritic fluid be considerably above that find in normal blood serum , but be comparable with those of corresponding case . the effusion occur in serous cavity differ from the cutaneous one by the effusion occur in serous cavity higher protein content . the highest value be attain in the pleural fluid , in which almost the same as     that in normal blood serum be almost the same as that in normal blood serum . the incoagulable nitrogen in all of they be uniformly low . the chloride vary in amount accord to the nature of the case . in the effusion of inflammatory origin the highest value be lower than those find in the blood . in the pleural fluid of other than inflammatory origin the chloride content of  the abdominal or pleuritic fluid be either the same or higher than that in normal blood serum serum . the globulin-albumin ratio in all of these fluid except one -lrb- the globulin-albumin ratio in all of these fluid except one -lrb- table iii , fluid 61 -rrb- , fluid 61 -rrb- be higher than that in normal blood serum . otherwise the highest value be present by a pleural fluid from a case of nephritis -lrb- the globulin-albumin ratio in all of these fluid except one -lrb-  the globulin-albumin ratio in all of these fluid except one -lrb- table iii , fluid 61 -rrb- , fluid 61 -rrb- , fluid 205 -rrb- and the lowest by a empyema fluid -lrb- the globulin-albumin ratio in all of these fluid except one -lrb-  the globulin-albumin ratio in all of these fluid except one -lrb- table iii , fluid 61 -rrb- , fluid 61 -rrb- , fluid 30 -rrb- . the latter case be of especial interest because of the theory , first propound by Schmidt , that the leucocyte in the purulent fluid be largely responsible for high globulin content . the abdominal fluid in general be less rich in protein than the pleural effusion . those of cardiac or other origin give the highest protein the highest value , but the globulin-albumin ratio be lower than in the pleural fluid or in the blood serum of corresponding case . only in two fluid do the globulin reach a percentage of 62 and 52.2 . in both these case the chloride content of  the abdominal or pleuritic fluid be also high . the incoagulable nitrogen in all of they be rather low . in one fluid of purely nephritic origin the effusion occur in serous cavity higher protein content be low and all of it be globulin . this be suggestive , when compare with the value obtain in the analysis of the blood serum of  corresponding case from nephritic case . the result obtain in the analysis of the abdominal fluid in general from cardionephritic case approach very closely those obtain in purely cardiac case . 
Solutions of the body of pneumococcus , obtain by dissolve pneumococcus in dilute solution of sodium cholate , by permit pneumococcus to undergo autolysis , or by first freezing , dry , and then grind in salt solution , be actively hemolytic for rabbit , sheep , guinea pig , and human red blood corpuscle . the substance on which this hemolytic property depend be very labile , much of the substance on which this hemolytic property depend activity be lose on pass through a filter , and the substance on which this hemolytic property depend be destroy by the action of trypsin . in the substance on which this hemolytic property depend property the substance on which this hemolytic property depend correspond to the substance contain in such solution which cause the death of guinea pig on intravenous injection . the substance on which this hemolytic property depend activity be prevent by the presence of minute amount of cholesterin . follow the injection of this solution into rabbit and sheep , the serum of these animal acquire increase power of inhibit the injection of this solution into rabbit and sheep hemolytic action . the injection of this solution into rabbit and sheep therefore possess antigenic property . it may therefore be conclude that pneumococcus contain a toxin that be hemolytic for human red blood corpuscle . the substance contain in such solution which cause the death of guinea pig on intravenous injection be not simply a product of autolysis but undoubtedly exist preformed in the bacterial cell . however , it be not give up to the surround fluid as long as the body of the bacterium be intact . the surround fluid may therefore be consider a hemolytic endotoxin .

Pneumococci in contact with hemoglobin transform this into methemoglobin . this reaction occur only when Pneumococci in contact with hemoglobin be live ; this reaction be not induce by the culture fluid or by extract of the bacterium . 2 . this reaction do not occur when hemoglobin be add to a emulsion of wash pneumococcus in salt solution . however , if minute trace of dextrose be add to such a mixture , this reaction quickly occur . the dextrose may be replace by any one of a number of other sugar , and also by certain other organic substance , if the latter be add in large amount . certain other organic substance be not able to replace dextrose , but the dextrose have be impossible to determine any special molecular configuration on which this property depend . 3 . the formation of methemoglobin by pneumococcus probably resemble the formation of methemoglobin by pneumococcus by certain chemical substance , such as aminophenol . 4 . from the work of other it be probable that the formation of methemoglobin by pneumococcus be always the formation of methemoglobin by pneumococcus . in the formation of methemoglobin by reduce agent , the latter be first oxidize , this occur better in the presence of oxyhemoglobin . in certain instance a alternate oxidative and reduction of the transform agent occur , so that this reaction be continuous . the effect which the presence or absence of free oxygen have on the reaction with pneumococcus suggest that this occur better in the presence of oxyhemoglobin follow similar line . 5 . this reaction do not occur in the absence of oxygen . if the free oxygen be first remove , and then replace , this reaction occur more rapidly than if the free oxygen have not be remove . the presence of free oxygen in excess slightly delay this reaction , possibly because of the inhibition of the reduction process which form the first part of this reaction . 6 . the explanation of this phenomenon of methemoglobin production be not only of importance so far as this special reaction be concern , but also because this special reaction suggest a explanation for the manner in which pathological effect be produce by those bacterium which apparently produce no soluble toxin . 
we experiment have show definitely that guinea pig , once inject with sublethal dose of bacterial proteotoxin -lrb- anaphylatoxin -rrb- , acquire distinct tolerance to these poison . the degree to which such resistance or tolerance be develop be never very high , in no case in we we experiment exceed the ability to withstand one and one half to twice the fatal dose of these poison . during the three or four day immediately follow the first injection the animal appear to be slightly less resistant than be normal control , this depend probably upon the in jury do by the administer poison . tolerance begin to be evident after from four to seven day , seem to be most highly develop in about two week , but last in a diminish degree for at least as long as sixty day . we experience , in this respect , with the poison result from the contact of active serum and bacterium be similar to that of vaughan with the toxic protein split product obtain by chemical method . the development of increase resistance definitely establish , the question immediately arise : -lrb- 1 -rrb- be this tolerance specific ? and -lrb- 2 -rrb- can the development of increase resistance be passively transfer , with the serum , to a normal animal ? we have begin to seek answer for these problem but as yet we datum be too meager to permit definite conclusion . the significance of the existence of higher resistance in animal treat with bacterial proteotoxin -lrb- anaphylatoxin -rrb- be far reach both in connection with anaphylaxi and with immunity in general . we be not incline to attribute to the significance of the existence of higher resistance in animal treat with bacterial proteotoxin -lrb- anaphylatoxin -rrb- as predominant a part in anti-anaphylaxis , the chief as be assign to the significance of the existence of higher resistance in animal treat with bacterial proteotoxin -lrb- anaphylatoxin -rrb- by Bessau . for , in the first place , tolerance to these poison be never develop to a very high degree , and , moreover , the first place do not become evident until the three or four day immediately follow the first injection , while anti-anaphylaxis , the chief develop almost immediately after shock . however , there seem to we to be strong presumptive evidence that such tolerance to these poison may play a important and , possibly , a non-specific part in anti-anaphylaxis , the chief , the chief underlie and specific cause of this phenomenon be the exhaustion of antibody , or desensitization in the sense of Besredka . the relation of such tolerance to the resistance of the animal to bacterial infection be , of course , obvious if we accept the possibility of the production of such poison in the inject body and anti-anaphylaxis , the chief , the chief participation in the production of bacterial toxemia . we hope to throw more light on these relation in another paper deal with the aggressin-like property of bacterial proteotoxin -lrb- anaphylatoxin -rrb- . 
the mouse either normal or splenectomize after exposure to x-ray be markedly more susceptible to bovine tuberculosis than be normal animal . normal or splenectomize after exposure to x-ray be markedly more susceptible to bovine tuberculosis than be normal animal splenectomize a short time prior to inoculation be also more susceptible than normal , while those splenectomize eight to ten day before inoculation have about the same resistance as normal . the mouse splenectomize three to four week before inoculation have a resistance increase over the normal , as have already be show by Lewis and Margot . as x-ray in the dose use apparently affect only the lymphoid tissue and as the hypertrophy of the remain lymphoid tissue after splenectomy be so rapid that the circulate lymphocyte may be much above the normal by the third week , it be conclude that this evidence , take with the well known association of the circulate lymphocyte with tuberculous lesion , tuberculous lesion strongly to the lymphocyte as a important agent in the defensive mechanism against tuberculosis . 
the cause of the frequent localization of secondary tumor at point of injury be not know . we work deal with this problem . for the experiment the peritoneal cavity have be employ as offer relatively uncomplicated condition , and the fate of mouse tumor bring into contact with a peritoneal lining injure in various way have be study . the injection of a suspension of mouse tumor into a healthy peritoneal cavity have little success as a rule compare with a similar injection into the subcutaneous tissue . we have find that the resistance of the peritoneal lining thus indicate can be largely if not completely abolish by the preliminary injection of a mechanical irritant -lrb- Kieselguhr , lycopodium -rrb- . that the change thus bring about be independent of general immunity phenomenon be show by the fact that a local injury render susceptible the part of the peritoneum immediately affect and that the part of the peritoneum . special test show that the factor important in render the peritoneum more susceptible be the injury to the subendothelial connective tissue . susceptibility persist after the endothelium have regenerate over the react connective tissue . Schmidt have find that the cell of tumor embolus in the pulmonary arteriole be able to penetrate the endothelium of the vessel only after tumor embolus in the pulmonary arteriole have be provide with a stroma from the subendothelial connective tissue . we finding be easily explain on the basis thus suggest . a connective tissue highly cellular and perhaps still proliferate as the result of injury may well elaborate the stroma for a tumor more rapidly than normal connective tissue . test of no growth whatever . connective tissue react to a injury grow profusely and almost immediately when incubate in plasma , whereas normal tissue from the same region show usually no growth whatever . dead tumor fragment in contact with the peritoneum cause a change favorable to the lodgment and growth of later tumor fragment . it seem not improbable that the peritoneal dissemination of certain human neoplasm may be accomplish indirectly through the death of the first tumor dead tumor fragment in contact with  the peritoneum cast off . we observation have be purposely confine to the effect of injury on the peritoneal lining thus indicate ; but the lodgment and growth of later tumor fragment seem to afford the basis for a generalization . point of injury may be attribute with good reason to the presence at such point of a active connective tissue capable of elaborate a stroma rapidly and abundantly . for it be the proliferation of the subendothelial connective tissue to form a support stroma that determine the fate of free tumor cell , whether these lie on the peritoneum or within a vessel . 
a transplantable sarcoma of the fowl , know as Chicken tumor xviii , as it occur in nature , in we series , succeed better in chicken of a alien breed -lrb- Plymouth Rock -rrb- than in those of the variety in which a transplantable sarcoma of the fowl , know as Chicken tumor xviii , in we series originate -lrb- brown Leghorn -rrb- . this be not due to gross physical difference in the two breed but to some more subtle factor and one which perhaps act by influence the agent cause the tumor . this would seem that Chicken tumor xviii , as it occur in nature , as   Chicken tumor xviii , as it occur in nature , as it occur in nature occur in nature , be   Chicken tumor xviii , as it occur in nature , as   Chicken tumor xviii , as it occur in nature , as it occur in nature occur in nature . 
the phenomenon of natural and acquire resistance to transplant chicken tumor strikingly resemble those observe in the case of transplant mammalian growth ; and no more than those do those suggest that transplant chicken tumor have a extrinsic cause . that there may exist in fowl implant with a chicken tumor a resistance direct against the tumor-causing agent distinct from the resistance manifest against the alien tumor cell have be show in a previous article . both sort of resistance be present in a fowl in which a tumor have retrogress , the resistance in such a instance be acquire . the tumor-causing agent distinct from the resistance manifest against the alien tumor cell be largely specific , give little if any protection against the agent cause other tumor . there be some evidence that the condition upon which a fowl 's natural resistance depend be the condition upon which a fowl 's natural resistance depend . some evidence have prove impossible to protect chicken against the agent cause the simple sarcoma by inject      the condition upon which a fowl 's natural resistance depend with dry tumor material in which the tumor-causing agent distinct from the resistance manifest against the alien tumor cell have be attenuate by heat . the transfer of blood from resistant fowl to fowl with grow tumor be in we experience void of effect on transplant chicken tumor . 
previous work have show that the growth of the graft can be in many case prevent or retard by underfeed the new host or by put the growth of graft of transplantable tumor on a special diet . the effect of such treatment on large tumor have be little study ; and the effect on metastase and recurrence have not be study at all . apart from certain clinical observation nothing be know as to the influence on spontaneous tumor of alteration in a special diet . experiment with transplant rat and mouse tumor along the line thus suggest show that large growth of certain strain be check in they development by underfeed the host , again on ordinary food upon a special diet -lrb- Sweet 's modification of one of Mendel and Osborne 's food -rrb- or in some case by simple underfeeding . two metastasize mouse tumor be two metastasize mouse tumor . they stop grow or grow very slowly in host underfeed on a special diet -lrb- Sweet 's modification of one of Mendel and Osborne 's food -rrb- . the flexner-jobling rat carcinoma , on the other hand , be unaffected by the most rigorous underfeeding on a mixed diet when this be begin after the tumor have be grow for a short period . experiment to test the influence of underfeed upon recurrence of the tumor give these result . the finding strongly indicate that generalization from work with transplant tumor as regard the effect of diet on spontaneous growth be unwarranted . by underfeed on Sweet 's food mouse with transplant tumor as regard the effect of diet on spontaneous growth , begin some day prior to operation , some day have prove possible in most case to delay for a relatively long period the development of recurrence of  the tumor and the growth of tumor bit -lrb- the graft -rrb- disseminate at the time of surgical interference . the treatment entail great loss of weight . tumor mouse keep on ordinary diet previous to operation , but put thereafter on a abundant ration of Sweet 's food , develop recurrence of  the tumor as early as the tumor mouse on ordinary diet ; whereas the growth of auto-implant be , relatively speak , much delay . these result seem attributable rather to a gradual malnutrition induce by the special food than to the circumstance that a gradual malnutrition induce by the special food lack a growth principle . in none of the dieted mouse be a definite cure obtain . ordinarily a recurrence appear and the graft begin to grow soon after the host , again on ordinary food , again on ordinary food , have regain weight . a few spontaneous tumor seem absolutely unaffected by the most rigorous dieting . wound heal with marked slowness in animal that have become thin as a result of dieting , and a inert foreign body -lrb- agar-agar -rrb- inject subcutaneously be very slowly encapsulate and organize . in the one that would prove,-if experience with the dieted mouse fact may be find a suggestion as to the method whereby dieting delay the growth of tumor bit -lrb- the graft -rrb- disseminate at the time of surgical interference . for a suggestion may well be that , with a lessen proliferative activity of  the host , again on ordinary food , again on ordinary food tissue , the elaboration of a vascularize and support stroma such as most tumor depend upon for the one that would prove,-if experience with the dieted mouse the growth of tumor bit -lrb- the graft -rrb- disseminate at the time of surgical interference , at least indirectly , be much delay . the rapid growth of tumor in emaciate individual be not incompatible with the present finding . such growth may be consequent upon a selection in the host of those cell most fit to cope with the increasingly difficult nutritive condition . but experiment design to demonstrate this have be unsuccessful . it be conceivable that recurrence of certain human tumor and the development of metastase and recurrence may be delay or prevent for a period by method somewhat similar to those employ against spontaneous mouse tumor in the present investigation . but generally speak only the more malignant human tumor would require such palliative measure , and the one that would prove,-if experience with the dieted mouse be precisely the one that would prove,-if experience with the dieted mouse be a index,-least amenable to alteration in the nutrition of  the host , again on ordinary food , again on ordinary food . 
1 . intact bacterium probably resist tryptic digestion because of the absence of a expose protein substrate . 2 . dry organism resist digestion in a degree proportional to they content of unsaturated lipoid . 3 . lipoidal extractive reduce the resistance to tryptic digestion . 4 . the extract lipoid -lrb- saponify -rrb- be antitryptic in a degree proportional to the extract lipoid unsaturation . 5 . the inactivation of the antiferment in gram-negative organism be probably due to change in the degree of lipoidal dispersion . 6 . bacterium adsorb lipoid from the serum when incubate at 37 degree c . such organism when dry be find to be more resistant to tryptic digestion than untreated organism . 
1 . the antitryptic titer of the serum can be increase by subcutaneous injection of serum lipoid -lrb- antitrypsin -rrb- and of serum lipoid -lrb- antitrypsin -rrb- from egg yolk . 2 . animal so inject show a relative immunity to acute anaphylactic shock -lrb- two minimum lethal dose -rrb- . 3 . extraction of lipoid contain in antigen increase the toxicity of the antigen when inject into a sensitize animal . 4 . sublethal dose of soap solution inject simultaneously with the antigen -lrb- purify horse serum albumen -rrb- prevent anaphylactic shock . 5 . the refractory state follow anaphylactic shock be relate in part to a increase in the serum . 
rachitic change in the bone and tooth occur in young albino rat as the result of spontaneous disease , possibly of infective origin . this disease be often , but not always , accompany by a arrest of growth and malnutrition . there be no valid reason for attribute such lesion to the loss of thymic function . in some of young albino rat as the result of spontaneous disease show this disease , a unusual number of mitosis be find in the parathyroid gland , but no evidence of injury to these structure . some of  young albino rat as the result of spontaneous disease have not be find possible to confirm the statement of Klose and Magnini as to the fatal effect of complete thymus extirpation in young albino rat as the result of spontaneous disease . 
we have describe the method use in determine the influence of certain substance on the tumor growth , and we measure approximately the degree of reliability of the quantitative method use . we examine with these method various class of certain substance , - distilled water , a number of inorganic salt , inorganic colloidal substance , various organic colloidal and non-colloidal substance , especially various proteid , tuberculin and hirudin alone as well as in combination with other substance . - distilled water , a number of inorganic salt , inorganic colloidal substance , various organic colloidal and non-colloidal substance , various inorganic sulphur preparation , and various inorganic salt do not show a inhibiting effect on the tumor growth sufficient to be detect by means of we first method . only in the case of gold potassium cyanide be there possibly a slightly retard influence present . on the other hand , certain colloidal solution of heavy metal -lrb- copper , platinum , gold -rrb- retard the growth of a number of tumor of inject animal . certain combination of copper salt and casein act in a similar manner . of the organic substance use , casein , nucleoproteid , and hirudin be active , while the other proteid test , as well as various other organic substance and tuberculin and lecithin , seem to be either without effect or weaker than the other substance mention as retard the tumor growth . hirudin be active and cause in addition to the tumor growth inhibit influence the retrogression of a certain number of tumor . a combination of hirudin be a combination of hirudin with colloidal copper and of hirudin with nucleoproteid . one single injection of casein , nucleoproteid , and hirudin , or one single injection of   casein , nucleoproteid , and hirudin , lead to a more or less marked edematous condition of a certain number of tumor , while hirudin cause in addition , in marked hemorrhage in or around the tumor , marked hemorrhage in or around the tumor . other substance which we test do not show a inhibiting effect on  the tumor growth , although they inhibit action on the tumor growth may have be equally strong . very young tumor -lrb- two to six day old -rrb- be not retard in they the tumor growth through injection of colloidal copper or hirudin , while nine to thirteen day old tumor be , independently of they size on the ninth day , inhibit in approximately the same relative degree ; absolutely , however , the more rapidly grow smaller tumor be more markedly inhibit than the normally more slowly grow larger tumor . 
1 . through a set of preliminary injection of colloidal copper or hirudin , give from the second to the sixth day after transplantation , we can weaken the effect of injection of the same substance give from the ninth to the thirteenth day after transplantation . 2 . injection of colloidal copper give before the transplantation of the tumor lead to a weakening of the effect of injection of the same substance give from the ninth to the thirteenth day after transplantation of preliminary injection of colloidal copper or hirudin give from the ninth to the thirteenth day after transplantation . 3 . the same result can be obtain if we inject colloidal copper or hirudin into mouse from the second to the sixth day after transplantation to the sixth and from the ninth to the thirteenth day after transplantation , and use these tumor at the end of the series of injection for further transplantation into another set of mouse from  the second to the sixth day after transplantation ; the develop tumor be more resistant to the action of colloidal copper or hirudin than new control tumor . 4 . we may therefore conclude that the immunity have two source : -lrb- a -rrb- the immunity be base on change take place somewhere in the host organism ; and -lrb- b -rrb- the immunity be localized in the tumor cell themselves which transfer this immunity to the follow generation of tumor cell . 5 . the immunity acquire against colloidal copper do not protect noticeably against the action of hirudin , and vice versa . the immunity be therefore specific . 6 . we discuss certain general conclusion which may be draw from these experiment . we expect to test the validity of these result in further experiment . 
1 . gentian violet may be regard as a true vital nuclear stain . 2 . embryonic and adult tissue of the frog will grow in vitro in the presence of gentian violet of a far stronger dilution than that necessary to kill many bacterium . in these experiment , for example , successful tissue growth be obtain when gentian violet 1 to 20,000 be use , yet bacillus subtilis will not grow in 1 to 100,000 dilution and grow very badly in 1 to 1,000,000 dilution . this fact may simplify the technique of the growth of certain tissue by eliminate the risk of bacterial contamination . 3 . the use of stain in the plasma in which tissue be grow will probably facilitate the study of nuclear growth . 4 . gentian violet appear to have a certain selective action on tissue similar to that exercise by the dye on many bacterium . certain observation make last year in this laboratory -lrb- too few to serve as more than a suggestion -rrb- seem to indicate that another dye -lrb- methylene blue -rrb- act as a stimulant to the growth of connective tissue . these lead should be follow out and the effect of various stain study in the hope of discover dye which will exercise a sharp selective action on grow tissue . 5 . the growth of animal cell in a strength of dye much more than sufficient to kill many pathogenic organism lend encouragement to effort now be make in this laboratory to apply certain observation make last year in this laboratory -lrb- too few to serve as more than a suggestion -rrb- on the bactericidal effect of gentian violet and ally various stain to the treatment of disease . moreover , the ability of grow animal cell in a strength of dye much more than sufficient to kill many pathogenic organism to rid themselves of this dye would indicate that it may be possible to apply the dye to infected tissue and count on animal cell in a strength of dye much more than sufficient to kill many pathogenic organism to eliminate the material after the material work have be do . 
the cultivation of cell in vitro afford a valuable means of estimate the effect of tissue extract . tissue extract have a definite effect upon the growth of adult mammalian cell in vitro . the majority of tissue extract stimulate the growth of connective tissue , but liver extract inhibit liver extract . tissue extract be to a certain extent specific in they action upon the growth of parenchymatous cell . some cell be stimulate by one extract and inhibit by another , and those extract which inhibit one type of parenchymatous cell may stimulate another type . homogenous and autogenous extract be equally efficacious in another they action upon the growth of parenchymatous cell . tissue extract may be preserve for a short period of time without suffer any change in another power of affect the growth of parenchymatous cell . 
1 . Besredka 's living sensitize vaccine , give intravenously , do not produce the gall bladder lesion in the rabbit . 2 . the first transplant of this vaccine be capable of produce the gall bladder lesion . hence this vaccine be not entirely safe to handle . 3 . regular infection of   the gall bladder lesion have not be produce by carry a known pathogenic strain on rabbit blood agar , by successive passage through these animal , or by the use of freshly isolate strain . 4 . no evidence could be demonstrate in the rabbit of the immunity produce in man by vaccination with a whole kill vaccine . 5 . vaccine treatment do not cure the gall bladder lesion . 6 . with the present method of produce regular infection of     the gall bladder lesion in the chimpanzee and the rabbit , neither of these animal be suitable for decide the problem of the immunization of man by vaccine . the problem of the immunization of man must be settle , as some of the chimpanzee and  the rabbit already have be settle , by actual experience with large number of man keep under close observation . 
1 . we experiment show that the proteotoxin produce with typhoid bacillus and active guinea pig serum , by the general method of Friedberger , possess aggressin-like action in Friedberger , when inject together with sublethal dose of bacterium , the proteotoxin render they lethal . 2 . this action be not specific , since even when typhoid bacillus be use in this action production , the proteotoxin possess this property not only for typhoid bacillus , but for staphylococcus and prodigiosus bacillus , the only other organism with which we work . 3 . this action be manifest in the experiment only when quantity of proteotoxin be use which can produce a certain degree of systemic poisoning . 4 . it be not due to anti-opsonic action since the phagocytosis of staphylococcus in the presence of active serum take place readily in spite of the presence of relatively considerable amount of the poison . 5 . the aggressin-like action of the proteotoxin be probably due to the leucopenia that the aggressin-like action of  the proteotoxin cause . it be not likely that the leucopenia be dependent upon a negative chemotactic action , in the ordinary sense of this term , but it be probably due to the general intoxication of the animal , result among other thing in the poisoning of those tissue element which ordinarily react to infection with the mobilization of leucocyte in the circulation . the leucopenia have seem to we that the result of we we experiment be of interest also in throw some light on the general problem of virulence . the thought naturally suggest the thought that bail 's so call aggressin be nothing more or less than proteotoxin , or anaphylatoxin , or anaphylatoxin . the thought have be show by Friedberger and Nathan -lrb- 3 -rrb- that poison of this description may be form in the peritoneal cavity of animal , and if we examine the method by which bail -lrb- 4 -rrb- prepare Nathan aggressive exudate , it seem likely that Nathan aggressive exudate contain proteotoxin , or anaphylatoxin , or anaphylatoxin . moreover , although bail 's aggressin be describe as non-toxic in  bail 's aggressin , this be the proteotoxin , a result obtain by bail with   bail 's aggressin this . we have not yet , non-toxic in  bail 's aggressin be true , show that animal may be immunize against bacterial infection by treatment with the proteotoxin , a result obtain by bail with   bail 's aggressin , a result obtain by bail with  bail 's aggressin . but we feel that the mere fact that the proteotoxin tolerance may be establish , the mere fact that   the proteotoxin tolerance may be establish , be the mere fact that   the proteotoxin tolerance may be establish . further than this the analogy can not be carry since we do not know as yet whether the proteotoxin tolerance be specific,-a fact which would be necessary in order to identify completely these substance with the substance study by bail . in view , however , of the many objection that have be voice against this phase of bail 's work , and of the fact that a rapid accumulation of leucocyte in the circulation be describe as characteristic of aggressin immunity , this phase of  bail 's work seem not unlikely that even in this aspect of the problem aggressin and proteotoxin may eventually be identify . it be probable , also , if we reason logically from the premise which we experiment supply , that the power of invasion of many microorganism be intimately related to they ability to react with the active blood constituent of the infected animal . this have already be suggest in the work of Embleton and Thiele -lrb- 5 -rrb- . if , indeed , the condition of bacterial anaphylaxi or hypersusceptibility depend upon the establishment of a balance between the inject bacterial antigen and the active blood constituent of the infected animal , such that proteotoxin , or anaphylatoxin , or anaphylatoxin be form , a supposition render probable by much recent work , then we we experiment would tend to show that bacterial anaphylaxi imply , at the same time , the same time by the bacterium -lrb- 6 -rrb- . the condition of bacterial anaphylaxi or hypersusceptibility may even be that generalize invasion , after localization , must await 
1 . this method of determine the actual number of purkinje cell present in a give area of cerebellum be practicable and of sufficient accuracy to make this method of determine the actual number of purkinje cell present in a give area of cerebellum another useful means of study nerve cell activity . 2 . in 2 application to clinical case it be find that increase nerve cell exhaustion be accompany by increase nerve cell disappearance , although it be recognize that theoretically complete nerve cell exhaustion could be present without nerve cell disappearance on account of the individual die before phagocytic action could take place . 3 . this disappearance of nerve cell , inasmuch corroborate the theory and observation make on phagocytosis of nerve cell , inasmuch , inasmuch as this disappearance of nerve cell show that  nerve cell , inasmuch , inasmuch disappear from the brain . 4 . while there be too few case to establish a normal actual purkinje cell count , a normal actual purkinje cell count be of interest to note that there be 16.6 per cent . fewer cell in the case with the maximum cell exhaustion -lrb- 57 per cent . -rrb- than in the case of the normal man -lrb- 2 per cent . -rrb- . 
1 . agglutinin be present in the blood of patient suffer from lobar pneumonia during some stage of the disease in a large percentage -lrb- 73.8 per cent . -rrb- of the case due to pneumococcus belong in group i , ii , and iv . 2 . in most very severe and fatal case agglutinin can not be demonstrate , and it be probable that case agglutinin absence during the later day of the disease in a large percentage -lrb- 73.8 per cent . -rrb- may have unfavorable prognostic significance . 3 . case agglutinin be demonstrable by the technique employ in the blood of patient suffer from infection with pneumococcus mucosus -lrb- the group -rrb- . 4 . in certain case agglutinin may be demonstrable for only one day , and in other case agglutinin may persist for several week . 5 . when agglutinin be demonstrable agglutinin usually appear at about the time of the crisis . 6 . 6 have not be possible to demonstrate that treatment with immune serum have any effect on the appearance of agglutinin . 7 . the agglutinin present in iii be always specific for the type of organism cause the infection . in certain case the agglutination reaction may be more active or appear earlier when the homologous organism be employ than when other organism of the group be use in the test . in case due to organism of type iv , the serum never cause agglutination of any organism except the homologous one . 
1 . fragment of frog skin be cultivate in a mixture of plasma and muscle extract of the same species . 2 . a few hour after explanation , process of activity be see to arise , which finally lead to the formation of a compact epithelial rim around the fragment of skin . 3 . these epithelial cell undergo gradual transformation into a spindle-shaped type of cell ; in this form they resemble the spindle cell which have be describe as connective tissue cell . 4 . the growth of a rim of tissue around the explanted fragment of skin may be ascribe principally to the activity of a basal layer of these epithelial cell , these epithelial cell by means of the so call epithelial movement , but which later become separate from the compact membrane , and have assume a spindle form , spread accord to the manner of connective tissue cell . 5 . in contradistinction to a basal layer of  these epithelial cell ,            these epithelial cell , the cell of a upper and middle layer of the epithelium , remain completely inactive . 6 . the connective tissue of frog skin , for reason not yet completely establish , do not participate in the production of the rim of these epithelial cell , possibly for the reason that the connective tissue of frog skin , for reason not yet completely establish be early surround by the epithelium and be thus prevent from send out these epithelial cell into   the epithelium . 7 . a result of the change in the physicochemical condition bring about by the life in vitro , which become similar to the physicochemical condition normally characteristic of connective tissue be a result of the change in the physicochemical condition bring about by the life in vitro , which become similar to the physicochemical condition normally characteristic of connective tissue . 8 . a hollow epithelial sphere -lrb- cystic stage -rrb- fill with connective tissue be a hollow epithelial sphere -lrb- cystic stage -rrb- fill with connective tissue . 9 . during a hollow epithelial sphere -lrb- cystic stage -rrb- fill with connective tissue the epithelium again show a hollow epithelial sphere -lrb- cystic stage -rrb- fill with connective tissue normal polar differentiation , as a consequence of the physicochemical condition which now approach normal . 10 . the physicochemical condition which now approach normal also permit of the shed of cell in a vertical direction , although previously the production of cell in a horizontal direction have already become impossible . 
1 . a comparative study of the rest and regenerate epidermis of the rat , pigeon , and guinea pig show the connection between the structure of the skin and the proliferate power of the epithelial cell . we may at present distinguish two type of epidermal cell : -lrb- a -rrb- cell with less proliferative energy -lrb- pigeon and rat -rrb- , and -lrb- b -rrb- cell with a greater proliferative power -lrb- the rat , pigeon , and guinea pig -rrb- ; the former provide the element from which the type of a thin epidermis be build up , while from the latter the type of a thick epidermis develop . 2 . the regenerative stimulus cause approximately the same relative increase in the number and size of cell and nucleus in both kind of skin during regeneration , and the regenerative stimulus cause approximately the same relative increase in the number and size of cell and nucleus in both kind of skin during regeneration , provide that we base we determination of the number of mitosis on the same unit number of cell in both skin rather than on the same unit area . the absolute increase in the number of cell during regeneration be the absolute increase in the number of cell during regeneration . 3 . the number of mitosis and the size of cell and nucleus in both kind of skin follow a similar curve in the different species during regeneration . they reach a maximum approximately on the 7th day ; remain stationary or show some decline from the 7th day on until the time of the closure of the wound ; follow the closure of the wound a further fall take place ; but the figure remain higher than in the normal epidermis for a considerable period afterwards . there seem , therefore , to exist under the condition of we experimentation a period of approximately 7 day , at the end of which the regenerative stimulus cause approximately the same relative increase in the number and size of cell and nucleus in both kind of skin during regeneration reach the regenerative stimulus cause approximately the same relative increase in the number and size of cell and nucleus in both kind of skin during regeneration maximum effect . the wound represent probably a additional factor determine the curve of cell proliferation . failure of the wound to close at a early date seem to make the decline in the number of mitosis sharp after a maximum have be reach . 4 . the curve represent the thickness of live regenerate epithelium decline much more slowly than the curve represent cell size and number of mitosis . this indicate probably that even after the wound some push of epithelial cell towards the center of the former wound continue to take place . 5 . from the second day the additional growth of the epidermal tongue decrease in each successive period , if we use the length of the tongue at the beginning of each period as the unit of measurement . 6 . factor additional to epithelial movement and epithelial proliferation determine     the wound be factor additional to epithelial movement and epithelial proliferation determine     the wound and epithelial proliferation determine the wound . 
it have be establish that specific liver poison -lrb- chloroform , phosphorus -rrb- which cause histological change in the liver cell , decrease a valuable index concern the functional capacity of the liver . also vascular disturbance -lrb- eck fistula , passive congestion -rrb- with or without histological evidence may cause a fall in the output of phthalein through the liver . sufficient evidence have be bring forward to show that a valuable index concern the functional capacity of the liver be a valuable index concern the functional capacity of the liver . ether anesthesia for a period of two hour usually cause a depression in the phthalein curve during the twenty-four hour follow ether anesthesia for a period of two hour . Paraldehyde in dose sufficient to give anesthesia and stupor for a few hour will give adefinite fall in phthalein excretion . chloral and urethane usually cause a decrease in phthalein output when give in considerable amount . alcohol cause a drop in the phthalein curve when give in large dose sufficient to cause stupor for a few hour . the drop in a valuable index concern the functional capacity of the liver be demonstrate in the twenty-four hour follow administration of the drug . a drop in the phthalein curve to two-third or one-half of normal indicate a definite liver injury and temporary impairment of function . 
we consider themost importantcontribution report in this paper the fact that treponema pallidum can be cultivate in fluid media , without the addition of agar , together with tissue sterilize by heat . this form a excellent method of obtain mass culture for luetin preparation and immunological experimentation . we may add that while the tissue variety employ have all stongly favor the growth of the treponema , we have notice especially active and motile culture when lung and suprarenal tissue be employ . 
1 . the abderhalden reaction be specific . 2 . the property of serum on which 2 depend develop in experimental animal simultaneously with antibody during the process of immunization . 3 . it be impossible to observe by direct method the presence of digest ferment in the blood of immune animal . 4 . the abderhalden test may be resolve into two phase . a dialyzable substance appear in the second phase and be the result of the autodigestion of serum . 5 . the autodigestion of serum in the abderhalden test be due to the removal of antitrypsin from the serum by the sensitize substratum . 
1 . normal serum protease be not specific ; it be active in both dilute acid as well as alkaline media . both be destroy by heat to 70 degree c. for thirty minute . it be markedly impaired when heat at 56 degree thirty minute . 56 be inhibit by the unsaturated soap and lipoid . 2 . Guinea pig and rabbit serum contain relatively much protease ; the leucocyte be without proteolytic ferment . 3 . normal human and dog serum contain little or relatively much protease ; the leucocyte be strongly proteolytic . 4 . serum complement and protease be not identical . 5 . during various pathological condition the non-specific protease be increase in both normal human and dog serum . 6 . a increase in antiferment be in many instance coincident . 7 . during the abderhalden reaction the placental tissue become more resistant to enzyme action , because of the adsorption of the antiferment from dog serum . 8 . the dialyzed serum lose antiferment because of adsorption by the placental tissue or other adsorbing substance , include probably the dialyzing membrane . 9 . the serum protein make available for protease action by     the adsorption of the antiferment from  dog serum be the serum protein make available for protease action by the adsorption of the antiferment from  dog serum . 10 . the protease in pathological condition investigate by we -lrb- pregnancy , tuberculosis , and pneumonia -rrb- be non-specific . 
1 . the serum preserve the motility of nagana trypanosome better and longer than salt solution . 2 . to act best in this way the serum should not be dilute more than 2 to 4 time . undiluted serum be perhaps best . 3 . serum filter through a Berkefeld filter , bottled aseptically , and keep in the ice box preserve this activate property apparently undiminished for many month . 4 . serum preserve the motility of trypanosome better than `` sal physiologicum '' of Merck , and better than the Ringer solution of Meltzer and Carrel . 5 . serum preserve the normal morphology of trypanosome better than `` sal physiologicum '' of Merck , and better better than the Ringer solution test . 6 . the infectiousness of the trypanosome in serum be preserve at room temperature for at least 8 day . 7 . the vitality of the trypanosome in serum be seemingly better preserve at room temperature for at least 8 day than at ice box temperature . 8 . serum incubate with atoxyl do not transform serum incubate with atoxyl into a toxic substance . 9 . serum do not bind paraminophenylarsenoxyd , for the trypanosome in serum be often immobilize more quickly by paraminophenylarsenoxyd than trypanosome suspend in salt solution . 10 . serum be suitable for suspend trypanosome for certain experiment in vitro , and with proper precaution may be employ for transport virus from laboratory to laboratory . 
1 . the 10 per cent atoxyl in blood incubate at 37 degree c. for 1 hour , the toxicity of the 10 per cent give rise to a solution that be much more than ten time as toxic as and 1 per cent . . solution of atoxyl similarly incubate . 2 . when the comparison be make after incubation for 3 hour instead of for 1 hour , the toxicity of the 10 per cent ,  1 hour , the toxicity of the 10 per cent , the toxicity of the 10 per cent . solution be but slightly greater than ten time that of the 1 per cent. , provide the red blood corpuscle be not remove from the dilution . 3 . if the red blood corpuscle be remove from both the 10 per cent per cent . and and 1 per cent . . atoxyl solution immediately after incubation at 37 degree for 1 to 3 hour , the dilution of the 10 per cent per cent . atoxyl be much more than ten time as toxic as the corresponding dilution of and 1 per cent . . atoxyl in blood incubate at 37 degree c. for 1 hour 4 . after incubation with atoxyl at 37 degree for 1 to 3 hour , the dilution of  the 10 per cent , the red blood corpuscle leave at room temperature in dilution make from the 10 per cent . and 1 per cent . solution in blood increase markedly  1 hour , the toxicity of the 10 per cent ,        1 hour , the toxicity of the 10 per cent , the toxicity of the 10 per cent of the dilution make from and 1 per cent . . atoxyl , but increase very slightly the toxicity of the dilution make from the 10 per cent . atoxyl in blood incubate at 37 degree c. for 1 hour 5 . if one desire to produce a large amount of transform atoxyl by incubate atoxyl in blood incubate at 37 degree c. for 1 hour at 37 degree for 1 to 3 hour , the dilution of  the 10 per cent , strong solution of atoxyl should be choose in preference to weaker solution . 
1 . the transform power of red blood cell for atoxyl be apparently uninfluenced by a preliminary heating of the blood for 30 minute at 50 degree c. , but a temperature of 55 degree c. act for 30 minute at 50 degree destroy this property of blood almost completely . 2 . when a preliminary heating of the blood for 30 minute at 50 degree be for 60 minute , 54 degree c. and higher temperature apparently destroy all the transform power . 3 . after heating for 10 minute , 70 degree c. destroy almost all the transform power , and 100 degree c. seemingly destroy all . 4 . under the influence of certain temperature blood seemingly bind transform atoxyl , and under the influence of certain temperature of other temperature free the influence of certain temperature again . a temperature of 70 degree c. for 10 minute apply to the blood to c. for  10 minute incubation with atoxyl cause nearly all the toxicity of the solution to disappear . on the other hand , when heat to  100 degree    c. for  10 minute apply to  the blood to incubation with atoxyl for 20 minute in contact with fresh salt solution , a temperature of 100 degree c. for  10 minute apply to the blood to incubation with atoxyl leave the solution almost as toxic as if the blood have not be heat at all after its incubation . 5 . some of the transform atoxyl bind by blood when 5 be heat to 70 degree c. for 10 minute be free if the heating at 70 degree c. be prolong to 30 minute at 50 degree . see pdf for structure 6 . blood which have bind transform atoxyl give up most , but not all , of this toxic substance when heat to 100 degree    c. for  10 minute apply to  the blood to incubation with atoxyl . all , or nearly all , be free when the heating at 100 degree c. be continue for 30 minute at 50 degree . 7 . under the influence of 70 degree c. c. for io minute transform atoxyl may be make to enter the blood corpuscle , for the fluid above the blood corpuscle be render non-toxic and do not become toxic again when heat to 100 degree    c. for  10 minute apply to  the blood to incubation with atoxyl for 20 minute , provide 100 contain no laked blood . the blood corpuscle , on the other hand , when heat to  100 degree    c. for  10 minute apply to  the blood to incubation with atoxyl for 20 minute in contact with fresh salt solution , when heat to 100 degree    c. for  10 minute apply to  the blood to incubation with atoxyl for 20 minute in contact with fresh salt solution , make the solution almost as toxic quite toxic . 8 . lake blood in contact with the transform atoxyl bind by blood when 5 be heat to 70 degree c. for  10 minute behave like unlaked blood when heat to 70 degree c. and to 100 degree    c. for  10 minute apply to  the blood to incubation with atoxyl c. for 10 to 30 minute . 9 . this toxic substance when heat to     100 degree    c. for  10 minute apply to  the blood to incubation with atoxyl can be concentrate by heat the blood corpuscle in contact with transform atoxyl to 70 degree c. for 10 minute , centrifugalize , remove a large part of the supernatant fluid , and then heat to 100 degree    c. for  10 minute apply to  the blood to incubation with atoxyl c. for 10 to 30 minute . 10 . the power of blood to take up and bind transform atoxyl be destroy apparently completely by heat blood to 100 degree    c. for  10 minute apply to  the blood to incubation with atoxyl c. for  10 minute . 11 . the toxic substance into which atoxyl be transform -lrb- transform atoxyl -rrb- be thermostabile , but the transform agent in blood be thermolabile . 
1 . the administration of emulsion of the anterior lobe of the ox pituitary increase very markedly the rate of growth of the primary tumor in rat inoculate with carcinoma . the growth of small tumor be accelerate relatively more than that of large tumor . 2 . this acceleration be only evidence , however , at a certain stage in the growth of the primary tumor , subsequent to the twentieth day succeed inoculation . the administration do not enhance the tendency of small tumor to metastasize . 3 . liver emulsion do not cause a acceleration of the growth of carcinoma in rat . 
1 . two principal type of gonococcus may be recognize by suitable immunological test ; e. g. , agglutination and complement fixation . two principal type of gonococcus correspond to the adult and infant type of infection with the gonococcus , see clinically . 2 . on the basis of the immunological reaction of agglutination and complement fixation the strain of gonococcus isolate from three case of ophthalmia be class with the adult type . 3 . a polyvalent antigen for the serological diagnosis of a gonococcus infection should represent strain of the infant type of organism in order that both type of infection , infant as well as adult , may be recognize . 
1 . the production of lobar pneumonia in rabbit be dependent upon the introduction of organism into the alveolus themselves . 2 . in order to accomplish this the catheter through which this be inject must be insert as deeply into a bronchus as possible and the culture fluid inject with considerable force . 3 . large number of organism inject into the trachea just beyond the larynx set up no great change in the lung , even though the injection be forcible . this fact suggest the presence of a protective mechanism in the upper air passage , which , under normal condition , prevent the penetration of organism into the lung . 4 . if animal be subject to cold , alcohol , and the inhalation of irritating gas , the so call secondary factor in the etiology of lobar pneumonia in man , then the injection of pneumococcus into the trachea cause inflammatory change of the upper respiratory tract and occasionally pneumonia . 5 . the vagus prevent foreign material in the pharynx and upper respiratory tract from reach the lung . section of one vagus may be follow by pneumonia , while section of one vagus both invariably lead to this result . 6 . it be possible that the secondary factor mention above owe they action to they influence upon the vagus control of the upper respiratory tract . 
1 . dead leucocyte be constantly find in the pneumonic exudate . they rapidly undergo disintegration . up to the seventh day they do not form the majority of the cell of the pneumonic exudate . 2 . polymorphonuclear leucocyte with vitally stain granule be present in the pneumonic exudate , the vessel , and interstitial tissue of the lung in experimental pneumonia , but they be not demonstrable in the general circulation in the same animal . 3 . there be a marked impairment of the circulation in the pneumonic lung . 4 . the increase in the intra-alveolar pressure exert by the pneumonic exudate have no influence upon the circulation in the pneumonic lung . 5 . the impaired circulation result from the wide distribution of capillary fibrin thrombus . in man these be , as a rule , distribute with relative uniformity . in the rabbit the case be not usually the case . the thrombus be much more abundant in some area and may lead to localized necrosis . 6 . the circulation in the pneumonic lung be of importance in bring about resolution . only enough blood be allow to seep through the vessel to nourish the alveolar wall . consequently very little serum escape into the alveolus and the autolysis of the exudate by polymorphonuclear leucocyte with vitally stain granule be unhindered . 7 . the circulation in the pneumonic lung seriously interfere with the action of intravenous therapy upon the local lesion . 8 . the exudate in the pneumonic lung can be readily impregnate with a dye inject intrabronchially . this suggest a method of administration of therapeutic agent in pneumonia . 
follow the intravenous injection of a overwhelming dose of pneumococcus in normal animal there be a rapidly increase bacteriemia which reach the intravenous injection of a overwhelming dose of pneumococcus in normal animal maximum with the death of the animal . immunize normal animal , whether the immunity be active or passive , whether normal animal have pneumococcus in normal animal leucocyte , or whether these have be destroy by benzol , react differently . pneumococcus in normal animal have incommon the ability to cause the organism to decrease rapidly in number , and , as far as could be determine by the method use , to disappear absolutely in a very short time from the circulation . this may be call the immediate reaction . in actively and passively immunize normal rabbit the disappearance of the organism from the blood be follow by pneumococcus in normal animal destruction in the body and the ultimate recovery of the animal . this same result occur also in actively immunize rabbit deprive of pneumococcus in normal animal polymorphonuclear leucocyte by benzol . on the contrary , in passively immunize rabbit deprive of pneumococcus in normal animal polymorphonuclear leucocyte by benzol , deprive of pneumococcus in normal animal leucocyte in the same way , the immediate disappearance of the organism from the circulation be follow , after a lapse of from six to twenty-four hour , by a recurrent , gradually a recurrent a recurrent . it be evident that the immediate reaction be the immediate reaction . this finding , that the result of the intravenous injection of a overwhelming dose of pneumococcus in immunized animal may be divide into two stage , immediate and ultimate , have be utilize in the interpretation of the experiment that have be report above . 1 . normal rabbits.-in the normal rabbit the injection of a lethal dose of pneumococcus be follow by the same immediate and ultimate response . the animal develop a rapidly progress bacteriemia and die . 2 . passively immunise normal rabbits.-a diametrically oppose finding be obtain when normal animal be passively immunize . then follow pneumococcus in immunized animal the organism rapidly disappear from the circulate blood and the animal recover . the only apparent difference between these two group of experiment be the only apparent difference between these two group of experiment . tentatively , therefore , it may be conclude that the immune serum be responsible both for the immediate and ultimate reaction in this case . 3 . passively immunize aplastic rabbits.-a normal rabbit that have be previously benzolize , and in the same way deprive of the same way myeloid element , can not be successfully immunize . here the immune serum inject even in excessive quantity be follow by the immediate reaction , but   the immediate reaction be entirely different , - the animal die . it may be conclude , therefore , that the potent factor in bring about      the immediate disappearance of the organism from  the circulation from  the circulation be the potent factor in bring about the immediate disappearance of the organism from  the circulation from the circulation . furthermore , it be evident that the white blood cell of the myeloid tissue be necessary in order that passively immunize normal animal may recover follow the introduction of a lethal dose of pneumococcus . so far it seem that two element be essential in the immunity process ; i. e. , immune body and the white blood cell of the myeloid tissue . corroborative evidence of the importance of the white blood cell in the immediate reaction be offer by the hyperleucocytosis which follow the injection of antigen in actively immunize animal -lrb- gay -rrb- . the hyperleucocytosis which follow the injection of antigen in actively immunize animal -lrb- gay -rrb- occur in actively immunize rabbit deprive of pneumococcus in normal animal polymorphonuclear leucocyte by benzol inject with pneumococcus in immunized animal , after the organism have disappear from the circulation . the hyperleucocytosis which follow the injection of antigen in actively immunize animal -lrb- gay -rrb- occur at about the same time that the septicemia recur in passively immunize aplastic rabbit . 4 . actively immunize aplastic rabbits.-the experiment with actively immunize aplastic rabbit complicate the conception of the part of the white blood cell in the immunity process ; i. e. , immune body and   the white blood cell of the myeloid tissue . when actively immunize , benzolize normal animal be inject with a lethal dose of pneumococcus , the immediate reaction occur just as in the passively immunize aplastic animal . available antibody be present and cause the immediate disappearance of the organism from  the circulation from the circulation . the immediate and ultimate reaction in this case differ from that in the passively immunize aplastic animal 
the constant response of freshly isolate monkey heart to epinephrin be the constant response of freshly isolate monkey heart to epinephrin . freshly isolate monkey heart to epinephrin be perfuse with autogenous hirudinize blood dilute with Locke solution . the result be constant at high or low perfusion pressure , in beat or rest heart , and with all adequate dose . increase coronary flow be obtain constantly in rabbit heart under identical condition . in the light of previous work upon isolate human coronary artery , the general conclusion be draw that , while actively dilate the coronary vessel in the dog , the dog , cat , rabbit , ox , sheep , and pig epinephrin constrict the coronary vessel in man and the monkey . the coronary artery of the last two species be presumably supply with constrictor nerve of true sympathetic -lrb- thoracicolumbar -rrb- origin . 
a test be describe for the estimation of antithrombin in the blood . the chief advantage of a test be that the chief advantage of  a test be simple , and do not require the preparation of fibrinogen and of thrombin , which be difficult to prepare and to maintain in a pure state . the principle consist in titrate the antithrombin against normal human plasma ; in this way we obtain a estimation of this way power to delay coagulation . as the result of examination carry out by this method , the result of examination would seem that there be a wide factor of safety as regard the amount of antithrombin in the human blood , and that this inhibit substance may be increase to a considerable degree without markedly delay or endanger clotting . 
1 . different strain of trypanosoma lewisus represent the power of propagation and resistance , especially between the power of propagation and resistance to destruction . 2 . the biological status of a give strain of trypanosoma lewisus be subject to cyclic variation as the result of immunological reaction in the blood of the host . 3 . the factor limit reproduction and cause destruction of trypanosoma lewisus in the blood of the host be appreciably independent of each other . it be possible , therefore , to influence these process separately and even in opposite direction . 4 . the virulence of trypanosoma lewisus , manifest in trypanosoma lewisus highest form , be dependent upon some degree of reproductive fastness , strong antigenic action , and susceptibility to destruction , vary degree in the development of these property produce corresponding variation in the degree of virulence . 5 . by a properly regulate system of passage the property of a properly regulate system of passage a properly regulate system of passage   the virulence of  trypanosoma lewisus , manifest in trypanosoma lewisus highest form may be eventually so altered as to change completely both the nature and course of the infection . such a system of passage must be adapt to the particular strain of trypanosoma lewisi use . 6 . immunological reaction in the blood of the host exercise a dominant influence in determine the ultimate biological variation of trypanosoma lewisus . 
throughout the investigation upon which a large part of this paper be base the favorable influence of milk feed on mortality and growth be most apparent . mortality from all cause be frequently reduce to at least one-half of what obtain among the chick that receive no milk , while the milk-fed chick in some experiment gain twice as much in weight as those that be without this article of diet . although the influence of milk feeding be less pronounced on the mortality of chick that be artificially infect with bacterium pullorum , quite a appreciable difference in mortality be always note if no milk be feed at least one or two day before the first administration of the bouillon culture of the organism in question . practically the same result be obtain , whether sweet or sour milk be feed , and no difference could be observe in the relative value of ordinary sour milk and of the so call bulgaricus product . hence , the unique property of this food exist in the milk as such , rather than in any milk acid or milk bacterium that may be present . milk and lactose diet exert a very important influence on the character of the intestinal bacterium , especially in white rat and in the common domestic fowl . within a few day after the ingestion of milk or lactose a transformation of the flora take place in which the usual mixed bacterial flora give way to one that be more simplify , and in which bacillus acidophilus and bacillus bifidus be , as a rule , prominent . a few day after the ingestion of milk or lactose be to be assume that milk have this influence in virtue of the large amount of lactose which virtue of the large amount of lactose contain . other carbohydrate , besides milk sugar , fail to bring about such a transformation . the ingestion of foreign bacterium , even in large number , do not of the ingestion of foreign bacterium bring about a elimination or displacement of the common intestinal microörganisms . vastly more important be the influence of milk or lactose milk and lactose diet . the feeding of Bulgara tablet or other preparation which contain as the supposedly active agent the bacillus of Metchnikoff and Mazé , without due regard to the use of milk , can , therefore , be of little , if indeed of any , value . the beneficial effect which the feeding of Bulgara tablet be claim have be derive from the use of yoghurt , and other oriental sour milk product have in all probability be due to the milk as such , rather than in any milk acid or milk bacterium that may be present , rather than to foreign bacterium which the common intestinal microörganisms contain . this view be strongly support by the extensive milk feed some experiment on chick which be record in this paper , and also by the same result which show the influence of milk and of lactose feeding on the intestinal flora of white rat and of the common domestic fowl . 
the addition of a water-clear extract of pneumococcus to homologous antiserum produce a voluminous precipitate which carry down with the addition of a water-clear extract of pneumococcus to homologous antiserum the agglutinin and practically the totality of the protective body against pneumococcus infection in animal . this precipitate when wash and resuspend in saline solution to the original volume of serum protect as well as the whole serum . the protein content of such solution have vary from 0.09 to 0.34 per cent. , as contrast with about 6 per cent . in the original serum . the solution of this precipitate when wash and resuspend in saline solution to the original volume of serum be not necessary to insure protection , and when produce by dilute alkali -lrb- sodium hydrate -rrb- frequently destroy the immune body . 
1 . subcutaneous injection of benzol in rabbit produce marked destructive change in the hematopoietic organ , especially in the myeloid tissue . 2 . Benzol poisoning register a change not only in the form element of the blood , but also in the factor of coagulation . 3 . the circulate prothrombin be considerably reduce in amount and in most instance animal in which such a diminution occur show aplasium of the bone marrow . 4 . the association of extreme aplasium of the marrow without a fatal diminution in the circulate prothrombin suggest one of two possibility : either other tissue and organ in addition to the bone marrow be concern with prothrombin formation ; or a minimum amount of myeloid tissue suffice to maintain the quantity of prothrombin above a dangerous level . 
1 . proliferation of connective tissue in chronic uranium nephritis be early and progressive and due to a direct stimulation on the part of the uranium . 2 . the hydronephrotic theory fail to explain the phenomenon observe in the progress of the chronic nephritis . 3 . Carmine be deposit , as show by Suzuki , in the proximal convoluted tubule only , and in different amount in different level of this segment of the proximal convoluted tubule , so that subdivision may be make . 4 . regeneration begin about the fourth day , but vary in proportion to the dose of renal irritant give . 5 . the first cell to appear be the first cell to appear , and there be a gradual development of syncytium-like mass and giant-cell . these last be due to the rapidity of cell division . 6 . stain nucleus , deeply stain nucleus , which be morphologically identical with the newly regenerate cell describe by Thorel and other , be present from the first day of the acute nephritis and be persist renal cell which have be slightly affect by the toxic agent . 
in live culture of various kind of adult frog tissue , which have be make accord to the hang drop method , there occur , in many case , a transformation of the plasma clot by which the hang drop method become entirely change from a typical fibrin net both in appearance and structure . the change in a typical fibrin net generally begin when the culture be from two to three day old . during the change in   a typical fibrin net a typical fibrin net appear that the element of the fibrin net fuse or consolidate , and as a result a great number of fine wavy fibril be form which unite to form these freely intertwine , and these freely intertwine as they ramify through the area of the plasma clot . a typical fibrin net occur first in the region of the clot which lie next to the imbedded tissue , gradually extend to the distal region of the plasma clot , and in time-as a rule in about two weeks-the entire plasma clot become change from a typical fibrin net into a structure which to all appearance be identical with regular connective tissue . photograph of both living and preserved culture have be make to show the course of the plasma clot and the development of the fiber which be form . experiment have be make which show that the fiber which be form be not the fiber which be form . also time-as be not form by a intracellular action , but arise directly by a transformation of the fibrin element of the plasma clot . experiment have be make which indicate that a typical fibrin net will not occur unless a transformation of the plasma clot by which the hang drop method become entirely change from a typical fibrin net both in appearance and structure have come under the influence of the living tissue alone or of live isolate cell . however , mechanical means , such as exert tension on the clot with needle , may hasten the formation of the fiber which be form . also , in some culture , movement of live isolate cell appear to aid in the formation of  the fiber which be form . the living tissue alone , however , be able to cause the fiber which be form to form without the aid of any apparent mechanical factor . this be show by culture of various kind of adult frog tissue , which have be make accord to the hang drop method in which no cell movement occur and in which the plasma clot be undisturbed and yet a prolific formation of these freely intertwine may take place . experiment have be make in order to determine the true nature of the transform plasma clot and to see if the new fibrous tissue be still fibrin in character . the result that have so far be obtain from these test have not be entirely conclusive and leave the question unsettled . the transformation of the fibrin net result in a shrinkage of the plasma clot . the transformation of the fibrin net result in a shrinkage of  the plasma clot . also become very tough and resistant to injury and , therefore , entirely different from the fragile and easily destroy fibrin net when in the transformation of the fibrin net result in a shrinkage of  the plasma clot . original condition . it be believe that such a reaction must play a important part in wound healing . a study of the relation between connective tissue fiber form in wound healing and in embryonic development to the fiber form in the plasma clot be be make , and the fibrin net result will appear in a later paper . 
1 . the union of fresh serum of pregnant or immunized animal with the corresponding boil protein -lrb- substratum -rrb- be accompany by the formation of poisonous substance . 2 . the poison originate from the serum as a result of the poison autodigestion , and not from the substratum . 3 . the process of autodigestion may be determine by the specific or non-specific removal of the antitrypsin of the serum as a result of the poison autodigestion . 4 . the poison originate from the serum as a result of the poison autodigestion be toxic only for homologous animal . 5 . the autodigestion of the serum as a result of the poison autodigestion , if allow to proceed far enough , may go beyond the toxic stage . 6 . the biological property of the poison originate from  the serum as a result of the poison autodigestion indicate they close similarity to a product of    the autodigestion of  the serum as a result of the poison autodigestion , if allow to proceed far enough , and suggest that a product of    the autodigestion of  the serum as a result of the poison autodigestion , if allow to proceed far enough be a product of the autodigestion of  the serum as a result of the poison autodigestion , if allow to proceed far enough , and not of the protein outside of the serum as a result of the poison autodigestion . 
it be evident from this work and from the work of other that these organism be wide-spread in they distribution in the human body . other that organism have diphtheroidal morphology be wide-spread in they distribution in the human body be readily isolate from miscellaneous skin lesion , probably thrive better in pathological soil as saprophyte than in normal skin , although other that organism have diphtheroidal morphology be wide-spread in they distribution in the human body can be obtain quite easily from the latter . various strain can also be cultivate from the air , at least in this environment . aside from the air and superficial part of the human body , diphtheroid have frequently be isolate from the deeper region . Hoag , work on general paresis and certain condition of the lung , cultivate 199 diphtheroid , the majority of which be from the lung and respiratory tract , also in some instance from the liver and spleen . Hoag consider 146 of these isolation to be identical and classify these isolation as organism x. Robertson , McRae , and Jeffry likewise in case of dementia paralytica isolate what these isolation consider a identical strain which be closely related to the Klebs-Loeffler bacillus , from the inflamed ileum , stomach , tonsil or pharynx , bronchus , lung , and brain . these isolation differentiate these isolation organism from bacillus hoffmannus and bacillus xerosis . the fact that these organism have a somewhat unusual morphology , resemble as these isolation do a organism of known pathogenicity , namely . bacillus diphtherioe , should form no basis for assume that these isolation , too , be apt to possess these quality . when we consider the number of simple bacillary contaminator analogous to such organism as bacillus anthraci , bacillus typhosus , etc. , we can readily see how frequently this occur . the majority of the diphtheroid isolate by we stai ??? by gram 's method ; nearly all fail to resist the standard acid-fast method , although use of the very low strength of mineral acid allow the fix stain to remain in whole or in part . there be consequently nothing unique in the fix tinctorial property . these bacillary strain differ considerably in the fix power of cultivation . while the majority grow readily upon the ordinary laboratory foodstuff , other require special product for other growth and still other can not be grow even where special effort have be make . the fact that many strain grow slowly no doubt enhance other consideration as disease producer , as it seem to argue other difficult adaptation from other preëxisting site to a artificial environment . this reasoning do not apply when we consider the numerous causal agent that can so readily be cultivate directly from the diseased tissue , and again the fact that many saprophyte in other natural habitat be incapable of growth in vitro -lrb- figure 1 -rrb- . the most striking of the biological feature of these culture be the most striking of the biological feature of these culture . while many be white or creamy white , the majority range from a canary yellow to a distinct crimson , and one of the culture recover from a leper be a very deep dusky red or garnet . numerous combined shades of yellow and pink , include such color as salmon and orange , be present . some culture be distinctly pink , other vary in depth of color to a crimson . while many culture of identical color be obtain , the majority of many strain show some slight variance of shade . while , of course , the inoculation of diphtheroidal culture produce vary degree of localized inflammation if employ in sufficient dosage , probably for the two-fold reason of act as a foreign body and liberating proteolytic substance , still the diphtheroid isolate in the past have never be able to reproduce the clinical picture of the various disease from which still the diphtheroid isolate in the past be cultivate . the apparent reproduction of lesion in general paresis , in hepatic cirrhosis , and in leprosy do not form a ultimate postulate for the acceptance of organism as specific etiological entity . this be evidence by the fact that many saprophyte in other natural habitat be incapable of growth in vitro -lrb- figure 1 -rrb- that certain known saprophytic organism when use as control be capable of produce the same result . it seem clear that organism as broadly distribute as still the diphtheroid isolate in the past should be organism as broadly distribute as  still the diphtheroid isolate in the past 
the ordinary virus of epidemic poliomyelitis present in aseptically remove brain tissue of paralyzed monkey survive in a ascitic fluid kidney medium at the temperature of 37 degree c. for a period of at least twenty , but not of thirty day . under the condition of moderate anaerobiosis , the minute microorganism cultivate from poliomyelitic tissue tend not to develop in culture from the brain tissue ; hence the minute microorganism cultivate from poliomyelitic tissue presence do not complicate the survival test . the diffusion of the ordinary poliomyelitic virus from a noncomminuted fragment of brain tissue into a surrounding medium of ascitic fluid be so slight as not to be detectable by inoculation experiment conduct with usual quantity of the fluid . the specific effect of the microörganism cultivate from poliomyelitic tissue be not cause by a admixture in the culture of epidemic poliomyelitis ; hence paralyzed monkey must be cause by the pathogenic action of the microörganism cultivate from  poliomyelitic tissue . the minute microörganism be therefore to be regard as the specific microbic cause of epidemic poliomyelitis . 
antidysenteric serum can be safely prepare in the horse by the method of three successive intravenous injection of live culture or toxin with intervene rest period of seven day . when this method of immunization be employ , the specific antibody responsible for agglutination and protection appear early and rise rapidly . by inoculate alternately live dysentery bacillus belong to the shiga and flexner group a polyvalent serum of high titer may be prepare . a polyvalent serum so produce should be suitable for the therapeutic treatment of acute bacillary dysentery , irrespective of the particular strain or strain of the dysentery bacillus cause the infection . a effective antidysentery serum suitable for therapeutic employment in man can be prepare in the horse in about ten week . 
1 . pronounced case of Barlow 's disease may be produce in the fetus as early as ten to fifteen day after the commencement of dieting pregnant guinea pig with oats and water . there be wide individual variation . the scorbutic change in the skeleton be the scorbutic change in the skeleton . the fetus of that period , with practically no exception , die and show marked trace of impede growth . 2 . fetus from the later period of pregnancy be bear alive , and apparently fully develop , with comparatively slight change in the osseous system . 3 . even a short extension of the period of extra-uterine dieting on milk from scorbutic mother and later on oats and water be sufficient to change the latent scurvy into a highly pronounced case . 4 . the fetus as early as ten to fifteen day after the commencement of dieting pregnant guinea pig can not be keep alive longer than the adult animal , about twenty-eight day , either by intra-uterine dieting alone or by combined intra - and extra-uterine dieting . 5 . scorbutic mother show sign of disease at a early period , and be more severely attack than non-pregnant animal . death also occur comparatively often in the first period of gestation . 
vaccine virus free from all associate bacterium by means of suitable disinfecting agent can be propagate in a pure state in the testicle of rabbit and bull . the virus cultivate in this manner be not only devoid of all bacterium , but appear capable of indefinite transfer from one animal to another . sixty passage in rabbit of a pure strain have be make within one year . several transfer from the testicle be require to bring about accurate adaptation of the virus cultivate in this manner to the testicular parenchyma , so that continue propagation in this way can be certainly secure . during the first transfer from testicle to testicle the activity of the virus cultivate in this manner may be less than the original skin specimen from which a pure strain be derive ; but as the first transfer from testicle to testicle proceed the activity of  the virus cultivate in this manner rise until , when about accurate adaptation of  the virus cultivate in this manner be complete , the activity of the testicular equal that of the skin strain . the multiplication of no more virus be the multiplication of the virus within the testicle ; the quantity of virus remain about stationary until the eighth day , when diminution begin . at the expiration of five week no more virus could be detect in the testicle . the vaccinal process in the skin , cornea , and testicle of rabbit of a pure strain be practically identical whether the original skin strain have be the original skin strain or the pure testicular strain ; and the skin lesion produce in the calf with the two strain be also identical . in conformity with the finding mention in the last paragraph conformity with the finding mention in the last paragraph have be find that human being react to the pure testicular strain of vaccine virus in a entirely typical manner . in the case both of original vaccination and revaccination the vaccinal effect can not be distinguish from those arise from uncomplicated skin virus . pure strain of testicular virus be readily produce , and once secure those arise from uncomplicated skin virus may be propagate in a pure state by the method describe in rabbit and bull without difficulty and with economy . the pure strain thus obtain should supply a ideal form of virus for employment in the vaccination of human being . 
by feed to rat the tissue of the mouse chondroma they be render more suitable as host for the growth . use this method rat have be inoculate successfully with the mouse tumor and the mouse tumor have be transfer to three successive series of these animal . 
it have be show by we experiment that the serum of rabbit treat with emulsion of treponema pallidum contain agglutinate substance . normal rabbit serum also possess agglutinating power for this organism , but , as in the case of normal bacterial agglutinin , to a extent very much inferior to that possess by the serum of immunized animal . normal human serum will agglutinate similar pallidum emulsion of treponema pallidum , as will the serum of certain syphilitic patient with positive Wassermann reaction . whether or not there be a quantitative difference of diagnostic value between the serum of normal human being and those of syphilitic remain to be see . the serum of rabbit treat with emulsion of treponema pallidum immunize with strain a agglutinate Noguchi 's strain 9 in dilution as high as 1 to 500 . we regard as the most important result of we experiment the demonstration of definite antibody in the circulation of animal treat with dead emulsion of treponema pallidum . since the most important result of  we experiment be the most important result of  we experiment that the agglutinating effect be due to a antibody essentially the same as that which produce bactericidal , precipitate , and opsonic effect , i. e. , that there be probably one type of a antibody essentially the same , we believe that the demonstration of normal bacterial agglutinin establish the fact that in syphilis as in bacterial disease the host respond by the formation of antibody or sensitizer specific for treponema . spirocheticidal experiment with the serum of rabbit treat with emulsion of treponema pallidum the serum of rabbit treat with emulsion of treponema pallidum in vitro and in vivo , be in progress . 
1 . the malarial parasite be extracellular throughout the malarial parasite entire life cycle ; the malarial parasite be , when the malarial parasite be not free in the blood serum , the malarial parasite be attach to the external surface of the red corpuscle . 2 . adult parasite follow the same procedure in attach themselves to the outer surface of the red corpuscle as do the young parasite . 3 . adult parasite be most frequently see attach to surface corpuscular mound . 4 . corpuscular mound project at the periphery of the red corpuscle and encircle by the pseudopodium of adult parasite , be proof positive of the extracellular relation of the adult parasite to the red corpuscle . 5 . adult parasite attach to peripheral corpuscular mound be only find in appreciable number when the red corpuscle be not badly damage , so that peripheral corpuscular mound show more or less hemoglobin content . 6 . the nucleus or protoplasm of adult parasite extend beyond the periphery of   the red corpuscle be additional evidence of the extracellular relation of the parasite to the red corpuscle . 
it have be show in this investigation that digitali , administer orally to patient , can modify the t wave in the electrocardiogram . when only the wave itself , but that portion of the curve between the end of r and the end of t which be involve be direct upward , the the first change notice be the the first change notice , and the final change be the final change . only the wave itself , but that portion of the curve between the end of r and the end of t which be involve be not only the wave only the wave itself , but that portion of the curve between the end of r and the end of t which be involve , but that portion of the curve between the end of r and the end of t which be involve . instance in which the initial t wave have other than upright form be describe and patient behavior under the influence of digitali have be indicate . this influence of digitali on the t wave may be detect in thirty-six to forty-eight hour after the administration of digitali have commence ; this influence of digitali on   the t wave may persist as long as twenty-two day after the administration of digitali have be stop . instance where this influence of digitali on   the t wave persist only five day have be encounter . the unexpected length of duration of the sign probably explain why a second treatment with digitali require a smaller amount of the drug to produce the same effect , than the first . 
while preliminary treatment with culture filtrate or dead cell of the extremely virulent strain a give rise to vary degree of immunity , the exudative lung lesion develop after tracheal injection with live organism of the same virulent strain be not strikingly increase in any group or series of these rabbit . despite carefully graduate dosage in the preliminary treatment , none of the animal develop symptom of a definitely anaphylactic nature . in similar experiment follow sensitization with the attenuate avirulent culture aa , tracheal injection of virulent or avirulent organism of the same virulent strain fail to incite any definite increase in the exudative lung reaction . in none of these rabbit be symptom resemble anaphylaxi note . the immunity which be induce by the larger sensitize dose of culture filtrate of the strain in the virulent state be lack when similar dose of the culture filtrate of organism in the non-virulent state be use . extensive lesion develop in both sensitize and unsensitized rabbit when the strain in the virulent state use in the tracheal injection be one apparently combine moderate virulence with exceptional toxicity , indicate that the exudative lung reaction be one of adjustment rather than of acquire hypersusceptibility . when , in similar experiment follow sensitization with the attenuate avirulent culture aa , small amount of serum from normal rabbit , or from animal immunize to culture filtrate , be add to the culture before tracheal injection , a increase fibrinous lung reaction be frequently find . the present study would seem to give some ground for the view that while in pneumonia a hypersensitive condition probably take some part in the inception of the infection , the subsequent development of the diffuse exudative reaction in the lung be not directly due to a acquire hypersusceptibility , but to intrinsic quality possess by the pneumococcus the present study . the present study be carry on in the Department of Bacteriology of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University , New York , and later , through the courtesy of Dr. Charles Norris , in the Bellevue Hospital Laboratories . the present study be complete in the Laboratories of the the New York State Department at Albany . I be greatly indebted to Dr. Augustus Wadsworth for Charles Norris advice and criticism . 
in the study of the human cortex it seem well to follow the same primary division for the entire cortex , while in certain area some layer may assume certain modification ; viz. , in the area striata it seem clearer to retain the sixth layer ground type , of which the fourth be subdivide into three secondary layer . a especially interesting field for study , on account of a especially interesting field for study relation to the act of see , be a especially interesting field for study . about the calcarine fissure one can readily see with the naked eye a stripe of white fiber lie in the gray substance , call strium of Gennari or of vicq-d ' Azyr . this layer be consider by Brodmann in the second subdivision of the the fourth primary layer . the two most characteristic type of a especially interesting field for study be the two most characteristic type of  a especially interesting field for study the two most characteristic type of  a especially interesting field for study the area stria . the higher type of mammal afford excellent material for comparison . Minkowski 's experimental study of the dog indicate that the clinical , anatomical visual sphere be cover with the cytoarchitectonic sphere ; for last visual trouble can be cause only by extirpation of the area stria . the subcortical visual center in mammal undergo secondary degeneration through destruction of the area stria , and therefore depend on a especially interesting field for study . also certain part of the corpus geniculatum externum have a exact projection over certain area of a especially interesting field for study . 
some strain of bacillus proteus obtain from human lesion be pathogenic for rabbit , rat , and guinea pig . there be good evidence that some strain of bacillus proteus obtain from human lesion be also pathogenic for man . all culture obtain from source other than human infection be non-pathogenic for the laboratory animal . a non-pathogenic culture may be make pathogenic by the use of aggressin or by inoculation into the anterior chamber of the eye . Proteus culture lose aggressin virulence rapidly when grow on artificial media . the proliferative lesion be either the proliferative lesion the proliferative lesion the proliferative lesion . the proliferative lesion consist mainly of epithelioid cell apparently of connective tissue origin . no giant-cell of the Langhans type be present . the histological type of the lesion do not depend upon the strain employ . neither do the histological type of the lesion bear any relation to the clinical severity of the case . the ability to produce the characteristic lesion have no necessary connection with the toxicity of the bacterium . the proteus bacterium probably play a more important part in human pathology than be generally believe . 
1 . ethylhydrocuprein hydrochloride in very high dilution inhibit the growth of , and in 18 hour kill , representative of all four group of pneumococcus in vitro . the killing effect be generally see in somewhat lower dilution than the inhibiting effect . no constant or considerable difference be see in these action on representative of all four group of pneumococcus in vitro . the action of ethylhydrocuprein hydrochloride on the pneumococcus in vitro be so strongly specific that the action of ethylhydrocuprein hydrochloride on the pneumococcus may possibly be use as a test for a true pneumococcus . 2 . the inhibitory or killing effect of ethylhydrocuprein hydrochloride in vitro on bacterium other than the pneumococcus be slight or absent . the inhibitory or killing effect of ethylhydrocuprein hydrochloride in vitro on bacterium other than the pneumococcus be greater on streptococcus than on any other organism examine , but be still much less than on the pneumococcus . the action of ethylhydrocuprein hydrochloride on the pneumococcus distinguish between the streptococcus group , include streptococcus mucosus sometimes find in normal mouth , on the one hand , and the true pneumococcus -lrb- include pneumococcus mucosus -rrb- , on the other . 3 . Quinine hydrochloride inhibit the growth of , and in 18 hour kill , representative of all four group of pneumococcus in vitro , and kill the true pneumococcus -lrb- include pneumococcus mucosus -rrb- in vitro ; much stronger concentration , however , be necessary than in the case of ethylhydrocuprein . this effect of Quinine hydrochloride be also see on other organism , but in a less degree . 4 . ethylhydrocuprein -lrb- optochin base -rrb- have a well marked protective action against experimental pneumococcal infection in mouse in the case of type strain of all four group of pneumococcus ; a well marked protective action against experimental pneumococcal infection in mouse in the case of type strain of all four group of pneumococcus may be efficient against many multiple of the minimum lethal dose . 
the subdural injection of normal salt solution , normal serum , the subdural injection of normal salt solution do not demonstrably increase the permeability of the spinal cord or brain for salvarsan which be circulate in the blood at the time of the subdural injection of normal salt solution . 
1 . in rabbit transient and also permanent enlargement of the heart 's occur as the result of the intravenous injection of adrenalin , spartein and adrenalin , diphtheria toxin , and adrenalin , spartein and adrenalin . 2 . transient and permanent enlargement of the heart to the left be associate with decrease in the size of the upwardly direct wave of the Q , r , s group in lead ii of the electrocardiogram and increase in the downwardly direct . transient enlargement to the right be associate with change in the opposite direction . 3 . the stage in the process of enlargement have be observe and be associate with gradual change in the upwardly direct wave of the Q . 4 . a diminution in the size of all the wave of the Q , r , s group be observe in degenerative condition of the heart muscle . 5 . extreme degeneration of the structure of the heart 's be associate with slowing of the heart 's action , lengthen of conduction time -lrb- p-q -rrb- , and lengthening of the time occupy by the individual wave of the electrocardiogram . 6 . ectopic ventricular contraction be see in rabbit inject intravenously with suspension of live streptococcus . 
1 . there be case in which epithelial cell inclusion may alone be present in the conjunctival smear . in such case no other pathogenic organism , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus , such as the Koch-Weeks    no other pathogenic organism , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus , such as the Koch-Weeks    no other pathogenic organism , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus , such as the Koch-Weeks       no other pathogenic organism , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus      no other pathogenic organism , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus    no other pathogenic organism , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus , such as the Koch-Weeks       no other pathogenic organism , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus    no other pathogenic organism , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus , can be demonstrate in smear or culture . 2 . the conjunctiva can become simultaneously infect with the inclusion body and koch-weeks bacillus or other organism . 3 . in case of acute or subacute conjunctival inflammation due to mixed infection the clinical feature of each infection may be present . the course of the inflammation be , however , more prolonged . 4 . within recent year , the Koch-Weeks    no other pathogenic organism , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus , such as the Koch-Weeks    no other pathogenic organism , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus , such as the Koch-Weeks       no other pathogenic organism , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus      no other pathogenic organism , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus have only seldom be find in we routine examination . 5 . the epidemic study be of a severe type . 6 . clinically it be practically impossible to distinguish pneurnococcal conjunctivitis from the the Koch-Weeks    no other pathogenic organism , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus , such as the Koch-Weeks    no other pathogenic organism , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus , such as the Koch-Weeks       no other pathogenic organism , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus      no other pathogenic organism , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus conjunctivitis . bacteriological examination of smear or culture be the only means by which the etiological diagnosis can be definitely establish . 7 . Conjunctivae of certain species of monkey be susceptible to the von Prowazek inclusion body , but not to the hemoglobinophilic bacillus isolate from case of epidemic conjunctivitis . 8 . the injection of conjunctival scrapings contain the von Prowazek inclusion body Prowazek cell inclusion into the testicle of rabbit produce no cell inclusion in the latter , while the injection of a pure culture of the hemoglofcinophilic bacillus cause a acute inflammation accompany by numerous clump of    no other pathogenic organism , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus , such as the Koch-Weeks    no other pathogenic organism , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus , such as the Koch-Weeks       no other pathogenic organism , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus      no other pathogenic organism , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus , such as the Koch-Weeks bacillus or the pneurnococcus , simulate the von Prowazek body at certain stage of conjunctival scrapings contain  the von Prowazek inclusion body Prowazek cell inclusion into the testicle of rabbit evolution . 9 . there exist a apparent morphological similarity between the degenerate form of this variety of the hemoglobinophilic bacillus isolate from case of epidemic conjunctivitis and Prowazek cell inclusion , both in culture and in experimental orchitis in the rabbit . but , as a rule , the elementary body of the latter be much smaller and more sharply define than the smallest granule of the former , while the initial body be bigger , more intensely stainable , and less definite in conjunctival scrapings contain  the von Prowazek inclusion body Prowazek cell inclusion into the testicle of rabbit contour than the hemoglobinophilic bacillus find in the infected conjunctiva . 
four dog have be subject to metabolism study before splenectomy and at interval of three day to three month after splenectomy . in three of the four animal the removal of the spleen be not follow by any disturbance of nitrogen metabolism , fat utilization , or the elimination of iron . two of these animal show no anemia , and the third only a slight reduction in hemoglobin and number of red cell . a fourth animal , study ten day and three month after splenectomy , develop eventually a definitely progressive anemia of moderate severity . a fourth animal show a slight loss of weight , a slight disturbance of nitrogen balance , and of creatine-creatinine partition , with a marked increase in the elimination of iron . we conclude therefore that the spleen have no important influence on metabolism , and that the disturbance occur in one of we dog be due to the coexist anemia and not to the absence of the spleen . 
1 . we have confirm the result of previous worker on tetrachlorphthalein , fibrinogen , and lipase . 2 . the total non-protein nitrogen , urea , and amino-acid of the blood serum show a definite and sometimes marked increase in phosphorus poisoning . these change be not so evident in chloroform poisoning , although previous worker sometimes occur . previous worker be usually terminal phenomenon . 3 . the urinary nitrogen partition between the urea , ammonia , and amino-acid of the blood serum be not always disturb . a increase amino nitrogen in chloroform and phosphorus poisoning be a increase amino nitrogen in chloroform and phosphorus poisoning . 4 . Sugar tolerance towards galactose and levulose be in general markedly decrease in both type of poisoning . 5 . in phosphorus poisoning liver functional change can and do occur without concomitant renal change . renal insufficiency usually arise as a terminal event . 6 . increase nitrogenous product in the blood -lrb- total non-protein nitrogen , urea , and          -rrb- be associate with a increase of these body in the urine . consequently , a increase protein catabolism , as well as renal insufficiency , be necessary to explain this accumulation . 7 . a terminal acidosis , as evidence by increase hydrogen ion concentration in the blood -lrb- total non-protein nitrogen , urea , and           -rrb- , usually occur . 
the intoxication which be develop when splenectomize mouse be feed with fresh spleen be more regular in occurrence when the feed experiment be carry out four or five day after splenectomy than when the feed experiment be do at later period . the intoxication which be develop when splenectomize mouse be feed with fresh spleen be easily recognizable even in the intoxication which be develop when splenectomize mouse be feed with fresh spleen less severe form by a lengthening of the coagulation time of the blood . a intoxication of the same character be produce when splenectomize mouse be feed with the mucous membrane of the stomach and upper small intestine . bone marrow and dry blood probably give the same reaction in a somewhat milder form . the other organ either give a intoxication of the same character at all when feed , or in certain instance the thyroid , adrenal , and salivary gland -lrb- mouse -rrb- give intoxication of a different character which affect intact mouse and splenectomized animal equally . the spleen or the gastro-intestinal mucosa be equally effective in produce the intoxication which be develop when splenectomize mouse be feed with fresh spleen , whether the gastro-intestinal mucosa be derive from heterologous or homologous species . certain experiment , not report in detail , indicate that the susceptibility to the intoxication which be develop when splenectomize mouse be feed with fresh spleen disappear in the coagulation time of the blood and that the coagulation time of the blood may be shorten by repeat feeding with sublethal amount of organ substance . 
experiment be report which show that in all probability the increase resistance to tuberculous infection which be impart to mouse by the removal of the spleen be the increase resistance to tuberculous infection which be impart to mouse by the removal of the spleen .     the increase resistance to tuberculous infection which be impart to mouse by the removal of the spleen can be restore by the feeding of fresh spleen . for the present we attribute these change to the removal and restoration , as the case may be , of a particular substance for which the designation tuberculosplenatin be suggest . a particular substance for which the designation tuberculosplenatin be suggest be assume to be relate to the spleen as adrenalin be relate to the adrenal gland . a particular substance for which the designation tuberculosplenatin be suggest be peculiar to  the increase resistance to tuberculous infection which be impart to mouse by the removal of the spleen but not to the species . a particular substance for which the designation tuberculosplenatin be suggest be not find in other organ of the body so far as we observation have extend . the absence of the substance from the lymphatic gland seem of especial importance in this connection . 
a method of measure the rate of excretion of urea , in term of the normal , as present in a precede paper , have be apply to the study of diseased condition and of the action of drug . simultaneous observation on chloride excretion have be make by compare the concentration of chloride actually find in the plasma with the theoretical amount , calculate from the rate of excretion of urea . observation make in this way have be find applicable to the study of various diseased condition . 
1 . a single small dose of ethylhydrocuprein -lrb- optochin base -rrb- , which by ethylhydrocuprein -lrb- optochin base -rrb- have practically no protective effect against experimental pneumococcal infection in mouse , be capable of increase the threshold value of the type homologous antipneumococcus serum at least fifty time . 2 . practically no protective effect against experimental pneumococcal infection in mouse be proportionately many time greater than a simple summation of the protective effect of these two body . 3 . no such effect be obtain when the antiserum use be one produce against a strain of pneumococcus from a group other than that to which the infect pneumococcus belong . 
1 . the serum ferment be practically unaltered by a primary injection of foreign protein . 2 . during the course of sensitization the injection of the antigen be follow by the mobilization of a non-specific protease which increase in rapidity and intensity as the maximum period of sensitization be reach . 3 . acute shock be accompany by : -lrb- a -rrb- the instantaneous mobilization of a large amount of non-specific protease ; -lrb- b -rrb- a decrease in antiferment ; -lrb- c -rrb- a increase in non-coagulable nitrogen of the serum ; -lrb- d -rrb- a increase in amino-acid ; -lrb- e -rrb- a primary decrease in serum proteose . 4 . later there be a progressive increase in the non-coagulable nitrogen , in serum proteose , and in serum lipase . 5 . the acute intoxication be bring about by the cleavage of serum protein -lrb- and serum proteose -rrb- through the peptone stage by a non-specific protease . 6 . the specific element lie in the rapid , mobilization of this ferment and the colloidal serum change which bring about the change in antiferment titer . 
in autoplastic transplant nerve a degenerative process occur which resemble the ordinary wallerian degeneration , but appear a little more slowly than the latter . the cell of Schwann be in a condition of survival and be capable of multiplication after the transplantation . in homoplastic transplant nerve I have find a degenerative process resemble a wallerian degeneration , somewhat delay . Schwann multiply , and for some time at least be in a condition of survival . after twelve to fourteen day a abundant and increase immigration of lymphocyte be observe , and from the eighteenth day the cell of Schwann develop a necrobiotic appearance . in heteroplastic transplant nerve numerous myelin ovoid be form during the first four to five day , but there be no proliferation of Schwann , and a wallerian degeneration be see . the graft become necrotic within about two week . the formation of ovoid that occur during the first four to five day after the performance of the heteroplastic transplantation do not reveal the condition of the life of the graft . this formation of numerous myelin ovoid be find in the nerve fiber when numerous myelin ovoid have be keep in a incubator for twenty-four hour in Ringer solution -lrb- nageotte -lrb- 12 -rrb- -rrb- or in homologous or heterologous serum , but this formation of  numerous myelin ovoid be not find in the nerve fiber after numerous myelin ovoid incubation in isotonic salt solution -lrb- nageotte -rrb- , the presence of calcium be necessary for the occurrence of ovoid formation . heteroplastic transplant nerve become necrotic . numerous myelin ovoid be unsuitable for bridge in case of nerve defect , and I result explain the failure of the attempt at heteroplastic transplantation of the nerve . if we wish to bridge a nerve defect by implantation we must use autoplastic or homoplastic graft . the occurrence of a wallerian degeneration in these graft during the first two to three week after the transplantation should make bridge a promising operation ; for in this period these graft during the first two to three week after  the transplantation resemble the peripheral part of a divide nerve and must be assume to be capable of regeneration , and thus be very different from dead material . I have study the process of regeneration , and shall communicate in a future article I result of bridge nerve defect , which be encourage as far as the function be concern . I result with homoplastic transplantation of the nerve have a bearing on the homoplastic transplantation of limb , which have be successfully perform in Carrel dog by Carrel . none of Carrel dog live long enough to show any function of the transplant leg . the practical value of a promising operation be dependent , of course , upon the return of function , and especially on the regeneration of the nerve in the transplant leg . I result with homoplastic transplantation of the nerve seem to indicate the possibility of a regeneration of the nerve in a homoplastic transplant leg . 
1 . the placental blood film examination be worthy of routine application wherever aestivo-autumnal malaria be endemic . this type of malaria when associate with labor and the early day of the puerperium can be more easily and certainly diagnose by the use of this film and a polychrome stain than by employ no peripheral blood film . the placental film in such a infection offer a abundance of adult parasite and far more evidence of the presence of pigment , while the peripheral blood film frequently offer but a scant number of the small ring or discoid form of a parasite . the examination of the present series reveal positive placental film in nineteen case , while but eight of these same case be positive in the peripheral blood film examination . on the other hand , no peripheral blood film be find positive in which the associate positive placental film do not reveal a far more abundant evidence of the infection . 2 . the puerperium can by this method be protect many time from a malarial outburst , and , as a rule , puerperal sepsis can be differentiate . 3 . the intricate vascular architecture of the mature placenta rival that of the spleen , liver , and bone marrow as a harbor for adult malarial parasite of this type of malaria when associate with labor and the early day of the puerperium can be more easily and certainly diagnose by the use of this film and a polychrome and as a storage for pigment . 4 . the localization of the parasite be unique . the one vascular system which particularly favor the development of the parasite but which at the same time be so situate that it may be spontaneously discard by the body at the climax of the attack be the one vascular system which particularly favor the development of the parasite but which at the same time be so situate that the same time may be spontaneously discard by the body at the climax of the attack . by this simple act late in pregnancy the prognosis for both mother and child may be improve . 5 . the pregnant state encourage attack of malaria by lower bodily resistance and by furnish a additional harbor for the development of the parasite . a tenable theory in regard to most attack of this nature , occur in case under professional care , would appear to be the development of latent malaria -lrb- malarial carrier -rrb- into acute attack toward the close of the pregnant state . the woman who expose malarial carrier -lrb- as the negro in this series that be deliver while malaria be present in     -rrb- offer favorable condition to the introduction of a primary infection . malaria frequently interrupt the late stage of pregnancy and sometimes cause the death of    and the fetus , more often the latter . the record at Ancon indicate that Ancon more frequently exert a harmful influence than other type of infectious disease in this locality . 6 . most of the child in this series that be deliver while malaria be present in    , be of a race that seem to possess a relative immunity to the ravages of malaria . this may account for the fact that the negro fetus more nearly approximate the full term of development when associate with this disease and be comparatively subject to a less number of the accident of pregnancy . many of the child in this series that be deliver while malaria be present in     reveal evidence of prematurity and be jaundiced , but , as a rule , many of the child in this series that be deliver while malaria be present in     develop rapidly . the commonest mishap be the commonest mishap . occasional still-birth occur and sometimes there be a fatal issue to both the mother and child . 7 . case under professional care diagnose as congenital malaria probably indicate that some accident occur to the placenta , because some accident practically never happen that fetal blood be positive at the time of birth , regardless of the degree of infection in    . many of the case now report in the literature as congenital malaria suggest immediate postnatal infection as many of the case now report in the literature as congenital malaria history , as we pathological and clinical record testify . 8 . the size of the intervillous space of the placenta and many of the case now report in the literature as congenital malaria adaptability in the localization of    the parasite seem to disprove to a certain extent the old idea that the localization of    the parasite depend on the smallness of the capillary caliber . if the case the brain should be more often the seat of a extensive localization than the spleen ,  the spleen , liver , and bone marrow , and placenta be the case the brain should be more often the seat of a extensive localization than the spleen , the spleen , liver , and bone marrow , and placenta , yet we anatomical record will not support that theory . a sluggish blood sinus with a large endothelial surface , a higher int 
influenza bacillus isolate from various pathological process in man differ widely in pathogenic power for animal , especially rabbit , especially animal , especially rabbit , especially rabbit . while the culture derive from the leptomeninge and blood , and rarely from the pneumonic lung be pathogenic , those generally derive from the respiratory tract exhibit little or no virulence for animal , especially rabbit , especially animal , especially rabbit , especially rabbit . the two type of culture as indicate by virulence for animal , especially rabbit , especially animal , especially rabbit , especially rabbit do not differ in kind , but only in degree , in relation to the serological test of agglutination , complement deviation , and opsonification . the two type of culture do , however , differ with respect to agglutination , complement deviation , and opsonification ability to undergo autolysis . while the virulent culture autolyze almost completely , yield a turbid supernatant fluid and little sediment , the non-virulent culture give rise to a abundant sediment and a clear supernatant fluid . the non-virulent culture incite far less antibody production in animal , especially rabbit , especially animal , especially rabbit , especially rabbit . hence , rabbit inoculate with non-virulent strain yield serum possess low antibody content . conversely , rabbit inoculate with virulent strain yield serum possess a higher content of antibody . in keep with and possibly because of the low antibody content of the serum of rabbit inoculate with the non-pathogenic strain , the rabbit so treat be not , as a rule , protect against subsequent inoculation with virulent strain . . influenza bacillus isolate from various pathological process in man therefore vary in pathogenic effect both for man and animal , but man and animal be not distinguishable by means of serological reaction into different type . apparently all influenza bacillus belong to one class or race irrespective of origin or virulence . 
a active antipneumococcus serum cause agglutination of pneumococcus in vitro and in vivo . the antiserum when inject into the circulation of rabbit suffer from pneumococcus bacteremia act in far greater dilution in cause agglutination as determine by the microscopic than by the macroscopic test . the antiserum when inject into the circulation of rabbit suffer from pneumococcus bacteremia cause a rapid disappearance of the diplococcus from the blood . a rapid disappearance of the diplococcus from the blood be bring about by instantaneous clumping of the diplococcus from the blood and the removal of the clump by the liver , spleen , lung , and possibly other organ . 
the treatment of pneumococcic septicemia in the rabbit by the large dose of serum be detrimental , since the serum cause the formation of large clump of bacterium in the blood which be take out chiefly by the vessel of the lung in which they accumulate and impede the circulation . the large dose of serum be also detrimental when they follow upon small one through which the small clump form be deposit in the spleen , liver , and other organ . in this instance , the large amount of serum lead to the destruction of the pneumococcus under the condition . the precise mechanism of this action be not know . the treatment of pneumococcic septicemia in rabbit by small repeated dose of immune serum can be successfully carry out . the number of pneumococcus capable of be bring to destruction through phagocytosis in the organ in this way be very great . not all the rabbit treat with small repeated dose of immune serum survive . those that succumb do so not to a general infection but to a pneumococcus meningitis . the explanation of this phenomenon be simple . when the number of pneumococcus capable of be bring to destruction through phagocytosis in the organ in this way originally inoculate be very great a small number penetrate into the subdural space . those in the subdural space do not come under the influence of the serum , hence those in  the subdural space be not agglutinate and prepare for phagocytosis , whence those in  the subdural space multiply and set up a fatal meningitis . the activity of the immune serum administer in this way against virulent pneumococcus be so great that a revision of we notion in the limit of power of the anti-infectious serum seem necessary . the activity of the immune serum administer in this way against virulent pneumococcus be patent that a relation between quantity of immune body and number of bacterium be not simply a relation between quantity of immune body and number of bacterium . it be more complex than that conception indicate . the factor of the leucocyte and the degree of they possible activity under the condition of the experiment come into play . Hereafter , in define the mode and power of action of anti-infectious serum the condition of cooperation of the body-force will have to be more strictly consider . 
typhoid bacillus be agglutinate promptly in the circulate blood of normal rabbit and quickly remove from the blood stream . the clump typhoid bacillus accumulate in the organ and be take up by assemble polymorphonuclear leucocyte in the liver , spleen , and possibly other organ . the phagocyted clump of typhoid bacillus be digest and destroy by the phagocyte . hence , the destruction be bring about by a entirely different process than be the destruction by serum and whole blood in vitro . while the latter be cause by bacteriolysis , the former result from agglutination and intraphagocytic digestion . lysis by fresh blood serum be not appreciably affect by spleen or kidney pulp , but lysis by fresh blood serum be inhibit by liver pulp . the action of the liver be referable to the action of  the liver biliary constituent , which exert anticomplementary action . probably in certain example of typhoid fever in man the typhoid bacillus in the circulate blood be inagglutinable can not be remove by the organ and hence be not phagocyte and destroy . the observe disparity between the ready destruction of typhoid bacillus by serum and shed blood and the resistance sometimes offer by the bacillus in the infected body be explain by the essential difference in the destructive process in operation within and without the infected body . 
1 . small quantity of antiserum bring about instantaneous agglutination of pneumococcus in the circulation of the rabbit ; the reaction be specific and occur in every case in which sufficient serum be give to influence the course of the septicemia or to prolong the life of the animal . 2 . the agglutinating titer of antipneurnococcus serum can be make considerably higher by add only a small quantity of culture to the test , thus make the test a finer differential . 3 . typhoid bacillus agglutinate spontaneously in the circulation of the normal rabbit ; the reaction be positive in vivo even in case in which undiluted serum give a negative result in vitro ; heat the bacillus to 80 degree c. for thirty minute render they more agglutinable in vivo . 4 . dysentery bacillus of the Shiga type do not agglutinate in the blood stream of the normal rabbit , but a small quantity of antiserum inject into the circulation of the normal rabbit ;  the reaction cause immediate agglutination ; while all strain of the Flexner group undergo spontaneous agglutination . 5 . non-virulent influenza bacillus agglutinate spontaneously in the circulation of the normal rabbit ; virulent strain remain in the blood unclumped . 6 . in all instance so far investigate of both passive and natural immunity , agglutination of the bacterium within the blood of the infected animal be follow by a rapid removal of the bacterium within the blood of the infected animal from the circulation of the normal rabbit ;  the reaction , and by phagocytosis and destruction of the agglutinate the bacterium within the blood of the infected animal in the capillary system of the viscera ; while those bacterium which be not agglutinate remain in the circulation of the normal rabbit ;  the reaction and produce a progressive septicemia . 7 . hence the agglutinin seem to play the decisive part in at least certain instance of bacterial infection . 
from the datum provide by we investigation we may conclude that in all pathologic process of the cortex which end in dementia and death , the fatty degeneration of the element of the cortex play a not unimportant part . the characteristic change for most of the psychosis be find in a great increase in amount of fatty deposit when compare to normal individual of the same age . in some process such as senile dementia and dementia praecox the fatty substance appear to fill completely the cell body , and these cell have apparently lose all some function power . it be not common to find the fatty deposit in the process of the ganglion cell , in which there exist a inclination of the fatty granule to flow together into large mass except in dementia praecox , and to a limited extent in senile dementia . in other case the pathological variety of the fatty deposit in the ganglion cell , in which there exist a inclination of the fatty granule to flow together into large mass be see to be diffuse over the whole ganglion cell . we be able especially to observe this in infectious psychosis , in general paralysis , and in epilepsy . the so call central neuritis assume a peculiar attitude in that the so call central neuritis plainly lead swiftly to a acute fatty degeneration of the ganglion cell , in which there exist a inclination of the fatty granule to flow together into large mass , in which there exist a inclination of the fatty granule to flow together into large mass . frequently a acute fatty degeneration of   the ganglion cell , in which there exist a inclination of the fatty granule to flow together into large mass , in which there exist a inclination of the fatty granule to flow together into large mass appear to be connect with the sclerosis of   the ganglion cell , in which there exist a inclination of the fatty granule to flow together into large mass , in which there exist a inclination of the fatty granule to flow together into large mass , especially when a acute fatty degeneration of   the ganglion cell , in which there exist a inclination of the fatty granule to flow together into large mass , in which there exist a inclination of the fatty granule to flow together into large mass be a acute fatty degeneration of   the ganglion cell , in which there exist a inclination of the fatty granule to flow together into large mass , in which there exist a inclination of the fatty granule to flow together into large mass . the behavior of the glium be not wholly uniform in the various disease process . in chronic disease process we often find that the extent of the fatty accumulation in   the ganglion cell , in which there exist a inclination of the fatty granule to flow together into large mass , in which there exist a inclination of the fatty granule to flow together into large mass do not correspond to a equal increase in the glium cell , while the otherwise acutely degenerative alteration in the nucleus of the glium be noticeable . in acute process we see regularly a equal accumulation of the fat in both species of cell . the condition of the cell in the vascular wall be wholly similar to those of the glium cell . we must therefore assume that in chronic disease the fatty substance have be carry out of the glium and the vascular wall while the fatty substance have be retain longer in   the ganglion cell , in which there exist a inclination of the fatty granule to flow together into large mass , in which there exist a inclination of the fatty granule to flow together into large mass . among all the disease process amaurotic idiocy assume a peculiar position . we have observe that in addition to the fatty material of the scarlet fat stain , still other fatty material , lipoid in character , have make those of   the glium cell appearance . while the study of the fatty deposit in the cerebral cortex offer some point for a differential diagnosis , yet it be not adopt in all case , since the distinction in individual disease process be not always characteristic . from the precede examination , however , in many case there result important finding which briefly we summarize as follow : 1 . in all degenerative alteration in the cerebral cortex the mass of the lipoid material in the ganglion cell in comparison with that in healthy individual of equal age be find to be considerably augmented . in the alteration of the lipoid material in the ganglion cell in comparison with that in healthy individual of equal age two type in general may be two type in general , in place where normally a small amount of fat be find , -lrb- b -rrb- a augmentation of the lipoid material over the entire cell . 2 . the first type we find also characteristic in senile dementia . the second type occur in acute infectious psychosis , general paralysis , and well advanced epilepsy . 3 . while the advanced lipoid degeneration of the ganglion cell in senile dementia have already be describe in many way , the advanced lipoid degeneration of the ganglion cell in senile dementia have appear from we investigation that also in the young chronic case of dementia praecox far-reaching fatty degeneration of   the ganglion cell , in which there exist a inclination of the fatty granule to flow together into large mass , in which there exist a inclination of the fatty granule to flow together into large mass   the ganglion cell , in which there exist a inclination of the fatty granule to flow together into large mass , in which there exist a inclination of the fatty granule to flow together into large mass in the second and third cortical stratum , likewise occur . important finding which briefly we summarize as follow : 1 should constitute a important contribution to the pathological anatomy of dementia praecox . 4 . the so call central neuritis represent a peculiar disease process accord to the appearance of a acute fatty degeneration of   the ganglion cell , in which there exist a inclination of the fatty granule to flow together into large mass , in which there exist a inclination of the fatty granule to flow together into large mass , since a acute fatty degeneration of   the ganglion cell , in which there exist a inclination of the fatty granule to flow together into large mass , in which there exist a inclination of the fatty granule to flow together into large mass reach a very advanced degree , and also in so far as a acute fatty degeneration of   the ganglion cell , in which there exist a inclination of the fatty granule to flow together into large mass , in which there exist a inclination of the fatty granule to flow together into large mass deviate from other disease proce 
1 . we have show that the type of renal lesion produce by compound of arsenic vary widely : while some arsenical produce change in which vascular injury predominate , other produce a equally dominant tubular injury . 2 . in either of these group the character and degree of the vascular or tubular injury produce by different compound show further variation , such that the lesion of different arsenical of the same group be not identical . each compound of arsenic that we have test , therefore , produce a lesion-complex in the kidney that be relatively characteristic for each compound of arsenic that we have test . 3 . the mode and character of the action of different arsenical of the same group be dependent upon the chemical constitution of each compound of arsenic that we have test . 
1 . toxic dose of all arsenical of which we have any knowledge produce definite pathological change in the adrenal of guinea pig . definite pathological change include congestion , hemorrhage , disturbance in the lipoid content , cellular degeneration and necrose , and reduction in the chromaffin content . 2 . the character and severity of the injury produce by different arsenical vary with the chemical constitution of the compound . 3 . from these fact , we believe that adrenal injury be a important factor in arsenical intoxication and suggest that therapeutic dose of some arsenical may produce adrenal stimulation . 
1 . the serum of rabbit when the base -lrb- optochin base -rrb- be give in oil subcutaneously ; somewhat less when the hydrochloride of the drug be give in water subcutaneously exert a bactericidal action on , and , later , inhibit the growth of pneumococcus in the test-tube . 2 . these action be most evident in the serum of rabbit when the base -lrb- optochin base -rrb- be give in oil subcutaneously ; somewhat less when the hydrochloride of the drug be give in water subcutaneously ; slight when the base -lrb- optochin base -rrb- be give in oil intramuscularly ; and least evident , or absent , when the hydrochloride in water be introduce directly into the stomach . to get these effect by the intravenous route , toxic dose must be give , and , even with toxic non-fatal dose , these effect do not last long . 3 . in the case of the base give in oil subcutaneously to rabbit in a dosage of 0.1 gram per kilo of body weight , the bactericidal action of the serum of rabbit when the base -lrb- optochin base -rrb- be give in oil subcutaneously ; somewhat less when the hydrochloride of the drug be give in water subcutaneously ; slight when the base be give in oil intramuscularly ; and least evident , or absent , when the hydrochloride in water be introduce directly into the stomach be at the bactericidal action of  the serum of rabbit when the base -lrb- optochin base -rrb- be give in oil subcutaneously ; somewhat less when the hydrochloride of the drug be give in water subcutaneously ; slight when the base be give in oil intramuscularly ; and least evident , or absent , when the hydrochloride in water be introduce directly into the stomach maximum about one hour after administration , and the case of the base give in oil subcutaneously to rabbit in a dosage of 0.1 gram per kilo of body weight pass into a inhibitory effect about four hour after the drug have be give . 4 . in man the same inhibitory and bactericidal action of the serum of rabbit when the base -lrb- optochin base -rrb- be give in oil subcutaneously ; somewhat less when the hydrochloride of the drug be give in water subcutaneously ; slight when the base be give in oil intramuscularly ; and least evident , or absent , when the hydrochloride in water be introduce directly into the stomach be present when a single dose of 0.5 gram of the hydrochloride of the drug be give by the mouth or subcutaneously , but the bactericidal action of  the serum of rabbit when the base -lrb- optochin base -rrb- be give in oil subcutaneously ; somewhat less when the hydrochloride of the drug be give in water subcutaneously ; slight when the base be give in oil intramuscularly ; and least evident , or absent , when the hydrochloride in water be introduce directly into the stomach be not so marked as in rabbit when the base -lrb- optochin base -rrb- be give in oil subcutaneously ; somewhat less when the hydrochloride of the drug be give in water subcutaneously . 5 . when the optochin concentration in the serum of rabbit when the base -lrb- optochin base -rrb- be give in oil subcutaneously ; somewhat less when the hydrochloride of the drug be give in water subcutaneously ; slight when the base be give in oil intramuscularly ; and least evident , or absent , when the hydrochloride in water be introduce directly into the stomach have , apparently , . diminish to a certain point in relation to the number of pneumococcus present , the pneumococcus which have survive the bactericidal action for a few hour acquire the power of grow freely . 
1 . the crisis in pneumonia be usually accompany by -lrb- a -rrb- decrease in the serum antiferment ; -lrb- b -rrb- the mobilization of a non-specific protease in the serum ; -lrb- c -rrb- a increase in serum lipase ; -lrb- d -rrb- a decrease in the non-coagulable nitrogen , and of the proteose in the serum . 2 . the crisis in pneumonia be associate with the beginning of a active autolysis , a active autolysis depend on a altered relation between the ferment-antiferment balance . 3 . the fibrin and leucocytic debris must be consider as one of the potential source of toxic substance . with rapid autolysis proceeding , only non-toxic material be absorb . 
1 . the intoxication produce by the intravenous injection of inert substance such as kaolin be due to protein split product derive from the serum protein . 2 . the kaolin act as a adsorbing medium for the serum antiferment , bring about a alteration in the ferment-antiferment balance . 3 . the intoxication produce by the intravenous injection of inert substance such as kaolin be accompany by a increase in serum protease , and of proteose . 4 . the serum lipase , the amino-acid , and the total non-coagulable nitrogen show relatively little change . 5 . the serum antiferment show a initial increase , follow by a loss . 
1 . in dog the toxic effect of the primary proteose be usually associate with the following serum change : -lrb- a -rrb- a increase in serum antiferment , with a follow fall in titer ; -lrb- b -rrb- some increase in serum protease ; -lrb- c -rrb- a increase in serum lipase ; -lrb- d -rrb- a decrease in serum proteose and amino nitrogen . 2 . secondary proteose produce -lrb- a -rrb- less marked change in the antiferment titer ; -lrb- c -rrb- only a slight increase in  serum lipase . 3 . the peptone which we have use -lrb- prepare from dog muscle -rrb- cause -lrb- a -rrb- a change in antiferment titer similar to that produce by the primary proteose ; -lrb- c -rrb- only a slight increase in  serum lipase ; -lrb- c -rrb- only a slight increase in serum lipase ; -lrb- d -rrb- a primary decrease in the primary proteose , follow by a increase later ; -lrb- e -rrb- a increase in amino-acid . 4 . a very small dose of peptone result in a decrease in antiferment titer , together with a primary decrease in serum protease . 5 . the peptone preparation be non-toxic when introduce into the stomach or rectum , while the intestinal injection be follow by a immediate intoxication . 
1 . the intravenous injection of kill organism be follow by the mobilization of a non-specific protease and lipase ; the rapidity and extent of this reaction depend upon the toxicity of the organism and on the resistance of the organism to proteolysis . 2 . the temperature and leucocytic curve bear no relation to the ferment change . 3 . the serum antiferment be usually increase after the intravenous injection of kill organism . 4 . of the organism study , the typhoid bacillus produce the most marked ferment change , and the tubercle bacillus the least . 5 . the toxicity of the dry organism can not depend wholly upon proteolysis in vivo , but must depend in part on the preformed toxic substance liberate on lysis . 6 . serum protease should not be consider as the sole exciter of intoxication through the production of protein split product ; it seem possible that serum protease function may in part be one of detoxication . 
by a process of sensitization describe a process of sensitization be find possible to cause arthritis in rabbit constantly after one intravenous injection of the streptococcus . this reaction be specific . by intravenous inoculation , without previous sensitization , of the streptococcus use in these experiment it be possible to cause rabbit only after three or more injection . a analogy be suggest between the arthritis induce by sensitization and the relapse in human rheumatic fever . a further analogy be suggest between the development in rabbit of arthritis after repeat intravenous injection and the development of the primary lesion in human rheumatic fever . 
the result of these experiment permit a comparison of the action of strophanthin in the normal and the infected animal . in cat the percentage of death follow the injection of 0.1 mg . of strophanthin per kilo of body weight be the same in normal and in we cat that . the number of recovery in this series be larger than be expect . this result be due to the fact that the dose inject be not the lethal dose , but the average lethal dose -lrb- 0.1 mg . -rrb- determine by Hatcher and Brody -lrb- 7 -rrb- and by Eggleston -lrb- 8 -rrb- . the dose which the latter actually inject range from 0.085 rng . to 0.16 mg. ; from these the average minimal lethal dose be calculate . in adopt the average minimal lethal dose as the standard one to inject , those of we cat that require more than 0.1 mg . naturally survive . the death rate be therefore low . the plan employ in dog differ from that use in we cat that . a lethal dose be inject in each dog . death occur a lethal dose a average of 0.12 mg . of kilo of body weight be inject . the same dose be require in normal and pneumonic dog . the effect of strophanthin in both group of infected and non-infected cat and dog be , therefore , identical . whether the uniformity of strophanthin action in the two experimental group may serve as the basis for assume a like uniformity of action in normal individual and in pneumonia patient be a subject which require further analysis . the difficulty in transfer the experimental result to pneumonia patient lie in the question of whether the type of pneumonia produce in the infected animal be the type of pneumonia produce in the infected animal . clinically , the the two disease present both resemblance and difference . the infected animal become definitely ill and show the symptom already describe . the illness , however , be of short duration and apparently reach the illness height in the majority of animal in twenty-four to seventy-two hour . before the expiration of this time , the temperature , though elevated at first frequently return to normal . many of the infected animal , when they survive , recover in three to five day . the mortality in dog infect with pneumococcus be give by Lamar and Meltzer as 16 per cent . in the present series of twelve infected cat , 16 per cent be also 16 per cent . these finding differ from human pneumonia in the follow particulars : the infection be not so severe ; the temperature , though elevated at first , though elevated at the first , soon fall ; the duration of the disease be short ; and convalescence be rapid . 16 per cent be slightly lower . Musser and Norris -lrb- 12 -rrb- give the human mortality at 21.06 per cent . pathologically the two disease also show difference . the gross appearance of the lung which Lamar and Meltzer be willing to identify with acute lobar pneumonia as find in human being be not dissimilar , but in the infected animal the consolidated portion be somewhat dry and Musser and Norris -lrb- 12 -rrb- fail to show a stage of gray hepatization -lrb- 5 -rrb- . the amount of fibrin present be small . there be comparatively slight congestion of the alveolar wall and of the alveolar wall of the bronchus . the relation of experimental pneumonia to the human disease have be discuss by a number of investigator . almost all believe that the two type be similar , if not identical . among the first to express this opinion be Sternberg -lrb- 13 -rrb- ; and later Gamaleia -lrb- 14 -rrb- , Prudden and Northrup -lrb- 15 -rrb- , Prudden and Northrup -lrb- 15 -rrb- , Wadsworth -lrb- 17 -rrb- , Prudden and Northrup -lrb- 15 -rrb- , wollstein and Meltzer -lrb- 9 -rrb- coincide with Prudden view . Lamar Meltzer , especially , have insist on the identity of the two process . on the other hand , Welch -lrb- 18 -rrb- in Lamar study of experimental pneumonia , say : `` many inoculation of culture of virulent pneumococcus into the trachea and lung of dog have be make in Welch -lrb- 18 -rrb- in Lamar study of experimental pneumonia , say : laboratory by Dr. Canfield and Welch -lrb- 18 -rrb- in Lamar study of experimental pneumonia , say : , but in no instance be Lamar and Meltzer able to produce a inflammation of the lung which Lamar and Meltzer be willing to identify with acute lobar pneumonia as find in human being . '' but Welch -lrb- 18 -rrb- in Lamar study of experimental pneumonia , say : add that , in the majority of these experiment , there be no demonstrable consolidation and that pleurisy and more or less extensive area of pneumonia be produce only in a few animal . the inference consequently can not be draw that a effect obtain with strophanthin in the experimental disea 
1 . it be possible to split a strain of the mouse into certain substrain in which the tumor incidence be in some way link to the color of the mouse . thus we could split off from the English strain , which as a whole and in various substrain with mixed color -lrb- English a and Sable -rrb- have a high tumor rate , substrain with light tan color and pink eye -lrb- IOI and Tan -rrb- which have a high tumor rate like the large majority of the english mouse , and pink eye -lrb- IOI and Tan -rrb- which have    a high tumor rate like the large majority of the english mouse . therefore , certain combination of factor which determine certain color of the mouse determine at the same time the tumor incidence of these strain or substrain . in the majority of case isolate family breed through several generation separately from the majority of the other substrain give approximately the same tumor rate as the other ; in some case , however , it may perhaps be possible to separate from the main strain a family with a different rate . 2 . the tumor incidence and the tumor age find in the earlier period of we work be approximately the same as in the more recent period . on the more frequent , the result obtain in successive generation of the same strain also agree well with each other ; the result obtain in successive generation of the same strain be fairly constant ; the deviation which occur be in most case due to the small number of animal observe in the certain generation . discard all the mouse die in the first or in the first and second period of life usually do not alter essentially the tumor ratio of a certain strain . 3 . a certain relationship exist between tumor frequency and the tumor age find in the earlier period of we work . on   the more frequent the more frequent the tumor , the earlier they appear in the various strain . this parallelism between tumor frequency tumor frequency and  the tumor age find in the earlier period of we work be , however , not complete . the tumor age find in the earlier period of we work seem to be as characteristic for a certain strain as a high tumor rate . certain substrain which differ in tumor frequency may show approximately the same tumor age . strain with similar tumor frequency may show a different tumor age . we may therefore conclude that in all probability tumor rate and tumor age represent distinct unit factor , which be frequently , but not in all case , link in some manner to each other . 4 . the age at which the maximum of the tumor appear vary in different strain . the maximum of the tumor may fall into the second or third period of life . on   the more frequent , the maximum of the tumor be reach at a earlier period of life in those strain which have a high tumor rate . but here also peculiarity exist in different strain . 
these experiment indicate , therefore , that when hemoglobin be set free in the portal circulation a larger amount be hold by the liver and convert rapidly into bile pigment than be the case when the portal circulation be set free in the general circulation , from which it reach  the liver more gradually and in a more dilute form , and that , under the former condition , over-loading of the liver with bile pigment more readily occur and jaundice be more apt to develop . a active factor in destroy the erythrocyte must , therefore , be        a active factor in destroy the erythrocyte , there can be no question that in this organ , when this organ be present , a large number of cell undergo                                                     a active factor in destroy the erythrocyte final disintegration after the action of hemolytic poison , and that the hemoglobin there liberate pass by the portal system directly to the liver . when   be remove ,                                                     a active factor in destroy the erythrocyte final disintegration occur in other organ , notably in the lymph node and bone marrow , and the hemoglobin from other organ pass not into the portal but into the general circulation , from which it reach  the liver more gradually and in a more dilute form , from which the hemoglobin from  other organ reach the liver more gradually and in a more dilute form . 
the anemia which develop after splenectomy be most marked in animal on a mixed table scrap diet of meat , bread , cereal , and vegetable , which be essentially a cook diet . control study in which a unilateral nephrectomy precede splenectomy demonstrate that the anemia which develop after splenectomy be not due to operation , hemorrhage , or accident of convalescence but develop only in the absence of the spleen . the result of study of the influence of the food , do not support the view that the anemia which develop after splenectomy be due to lack of iron in the food . observation on the influence of   animal on a mixed table scrap diet of meat , bread , cereal , and vegetable , which be essentially a cook diet show a more severe anemia in animal on a mixed table scrap diet of meat , bread , cereal , and vegetable , which be essentially a cook diet and suggest the possibility that heat alter some substance which , in the spleen , the body can not utilize . a final conclusion in regard to this point must , however , await the result of more detailed study now in progress . 
the development of the collateral circulation after ligation of the innominate and right common carotid artery for subclavian aneurysm be study in two case by measure the rate of blood flow in the hand 's from time to time . in a woman , sixty-eight year old , the flow in the right hand three week after the operation be two-seventh of that in the left . nineteen week after the operation the left hand flow be more than three-fourth of that in the left , although no pulse return until long afterwards . in a man , twenty-five year old , the flow in the right hand eleven day after the operation be between one-fourth and one-fifth of that in the left . seventeen day after the operation the left hand flow be nearly one-third of the left hand flow . twenty-four day after the operation the left hand flow have increase to more than one-half of the left hand flow . thirty-one day after the operation the left hand flow be the left hand flow , without return , as yet , of any pulsation . before the operation the left hand flow be markedly greater than in the left , notwithstanding the small size of the right radial pulse as compare with the left . the explanation of this fact be discuss . 
1 . liver tissue show fatty degeneration obtain from animal poison with phosphorus or chloroform contain a decrease amount of esterase . 2 . the serum of phosphorus or chloroform have a high esterase activity . 3 . the increase amount of esterase in the serum of      phosphorus or chloroform be not derive from the disintegrate liver cell as the esterase in the blood of the hepatic vein be less than that find elsewhere . 
1 . in cross strain know to diner in they tumor rate , the hybrid show in a considerable number of case a tumor rate correspond to the parent with a high tumor incidence ; in some case the offspring have the tumor rate of the parent with the low tumor incidence ; in certain case the tumor rate of the offspring be intermediate between those of the parent . that these result be not accidental follow from the fact that we could show in some case that two sister cross with the same strain or with the same male give similar offspring , and in other case we could show that the same individual cross successively with two strain that behave similarly produce hybrid with a similar tumor incidence . 2 . there exist some evidence for the conclusion that different strain in be cross with other strain differ in two sister power to impress two sister a tumor rate correspond to the parent with a high tumor incidence upon the cross . thus the English strain and the i and ii daughter of no. 10 have the tendency to transmit to the offspring a high tumor rate , while cream , silver , and some european other than 151 have a tendency to transmit a low tumor rate . while cross of these daughter of no. 10 with some european other than 151 or with no. 8 -lrb- 1/2 -rrb- show the high tumor rate of the mother , the cross of one of the same female with cream , silver show a intermediate tumor rate . 3 . we find further evidence for we the conclusion previously state that the age class , of the tumor and tumor rate be not dependent on the same factor . the age class enter into the cross as a factor independent of the tumor and tumor rate . thus we find in the cross between the first daughter of no. 10 and cream , and in the same cross and english silver usually a similar tumor rate , but the age class differ in conformity with the difference in the age class of the parent . we find , furthermore , that while in some case a tumor rate and a age class that correspond to each other -lrb- high tumor rate , early tumors-low tumor rate , late tumor -rrb- be transmit to the offspring , in other case a tumor rate and a age class that correspond to each other -lrb- high tumor rate , early tumors-low tumor rate , late tumor -rrb- transmit to the cross diverge . 4 . it seem that certain strain with very late tumor if mate with strain with earlier tumor have a tendency to transmit to the offspring the cross own tendency to very late tumor if mate with strain with earlier tumor . with a certain strain lateness of very late tumor if mate with strain with earlier tumor seem to be dominant , while a low tumor rate be not necessarily dominant in the same cross . this be noticeable in the cross into which the strain european + / - 102 or 103 enter as one of the parent . 5 . if both parent have usually a similar tumor rate the offspring have usually a similar tumor rate . there be , however , one exception to this rule in the case of the german + / - Carter mouse , in which the offspring show a much lower tumor rate and higher age class than either of the parent strain . 
the complete removal of the function of the pancreas concern in digestion be follow by marked change in the spleen and in the thyroid apparatus . second , the spleen show a extreme simple atrophy . Third , the thyroid apparatus exhibit a constant change show by the macroscopic transparency of the gland , by the microscopic increase in the amount of colloid , by the chemical increase of the iodine content of the gland , and by the functional test of the delay appearance of tetany after the complete removal of the thyroid apparatus . 
we may conclude that the feeding of dry thyroid gland to tadpole cause a early differentiation in proportion to the quantity fed or the percentage of iodine content of the gland use . with the larger dose and the higher iodine percentage , metabolism be stimulate to such a extent that the animal emaciate rapidly and die early , before there be time for much differentiation . with smaller amount and lower iodine percentage the size of the animal be roughly inversely proportional to the amount or percentage , so that a close association of differentiation with pigmy size be not characteristic of the thyroid feeding , as Gudenatsch seem to conclude . one may see early and marked differentiation along with large size . one all seem a question of dosage . the larger size be associate with slower differentiation , the smaller size with more rapid differentiation , and the smallest size may show slower differentiation at all , due to the extremely rapid and marked emaciation , and early death . non-thyroid iodine do not have this effect . the thyroid effect be inhibit by exposure to cold and by cracker feeding . exposure to cold probably act by lower metabolism ; cracker feeding , by substitute food other than the animal 's own tissue to meet the increase demand cause by the stimulating effect of the thyroid feeding . Gudenatsch in he earlier paper speak of the thyroid as stimulate metabolism , which lead to early differentiation and suppress growth . later Gudenatsch in he earlier paper seem to lean to a matter of word that the thyroid as stimulate metabolism , which lead to early differentiation and suppress growth possess some specific influence on differentiation . a matter of word may all be a matter of word , but we present conception be that we be simply deal with the well known action of thyroid on metabolism . as the iodine content increase , the thyroid as stimulate metabolism , which lead to early differentiation and suppress growth increasingly stimulate the metabolism of the tadpole , which undergo change in size , increase growth or rapid emaciation , accord to the strength of the well known action of thyroid . the tadpole be a larval form , the tissue the first to be stimulate to the metabolism of the tadpole , which undergo change in size , increase growth or rapid emaciation , accord to the strength of  the well known action of thyroid , and later the first to be consume , be naturally those tissue whose normal function be approach a normal end , and which , in the normal course of event , be about to undergo metamorphosis . hasten of differentiation seem then to ensue not as a specific stimulation of differentiation , but only to be the normal result of the stimulation of general metabolism . the seeming specificity of the normal result of the stimulation of general metabolism lie not in a new action of thyroid , but in the seeming specificity of  the normal result of the stimulation of general metabolism application to a living organism at a specific time in the seeming specificity of  the normal result of the stimulation of general metabolism development . most important , of course , be the confirmation of what we may be justify in regard as a established fact ; namely , that the activity and potency of the physiologically active substance of the thyroid as stimulate metabolism , which lead to early differentiation and suppress growth be measurable in term of the physiologically active substance of  the thyroid as stimulate metabolism , which lead to early differentiation and suppress growth percentage iodine content . finally , it may be point out that the reaction of tadpole to the thyroid feeding be so sensitive that the procedure might well serve as a biological test for the activity of thyroid tissue , superior even to chemical method . 
the foregoing experiment show that in cat a definite lobar pneumonia may be cause by bacillus mucosus capsulatus . judge both from the clinical course and from the pathological finding , this form of pulmonary infection differ from the usual pneumococcus type of pneumonia and closely resemble the so call Friedländer 's the bacillus or bacillus pneumonioe in man . in all instance in which a lobar pneumonia be find after the injection of the bacillus , a similar organism be recover from the lung , and in no case be this associate with other organism . the course of the disease in cat be very short , the animal develop early symptom of profound toxemia . in 87 per cent of the animal develop early symptom of profound toxemia show a lobar pneumonia positive blood culture be obtain . the pathological finding , judge from the early stage of the disease in cat , be subject to considerable variation . in some instance the process may suggest a pseudolobar or confluent lobular distribution . in these case the lung have a mottled , marble-like appearance . in the majority of these case , however , the process give a more homogeneous appearance , suggest a diffuse and uniform distribution . focus of hemorrhage be not uncommon in both . such area cause the mottled appearance sometimes find . in all instance the consolidated lung present a greater infiltration of tissue than be usually see in other type of experimental pneumonia . although the exudate as see on the cut surface may be abundant and especially viscid in character , this be not present in most case . the cut surface of the consolidated lung do not present a granular appearance . the histological finding be also subject to considerable variation . in most instance the infundibular and alveolar space be completely fill with a exudate make up chiefly of polymorphonuclear cell . associate with these be the capsulate bacillus , large vacuolated mononuclear phagocytic cell , and red blood cell , and occasionally small amount of fibrin . other organism may vary greatly in number . some section show space almost completely fill with bacillus . the contrast between space contain a exudate consist chiefly of polymorphonuclear form and a adjoining one fill with other organism be often striking -lrb- fig. 4 -rrb- . the bacillus find be both intra - and extracellular . the large vacuolated cell be the large vacuolated cell . both intra - and extracellular apparently be the first cell to become phagocytic . often both intra - and extracellular be see to contain as many as 10 to 15 capsulate bacillus , while polymorphonuclear cell in the same exudate contain other organism . the histogenesis of polymorphonuclear cell in the same exudate seem to be somewhat clearer from the study of these early stage of pneumonia . in many instance one see swollen , partially desquamate epithelial cell along the alveolar wall . these closely resemble the large vacuolated form . various type of these vacuolate large vacuolated mononuclear phagocytic cell be observe . these may well represent stage of development from the desquamating epithelial cell to the large vacuolated form . although similar cell may arise elsewhere , we have be lead to regard these in we study as epithelial in origin -lrb- fig. 5 -rrb- . the number of red blood cell and the amount of fibrin present in the same exudate vary greatly . small focus consist of alveolar space fill with erythrocyte be not uncommon . the fibrin be very much less abundant than in most type of pneumonia . from the above experiment it be see that a lobar pneumonia in cat can be produce at least by two method , either by intrabronchial insufflation of a similar organism or by direct injection into the vein , provide that in the latter case a irritant be introduce into the lung . in each case there be little doubt but that a local injury of the lung parenchyma be produce . without this injury -lrb- that be , by intravenous injection of a similar organism alone -rrb- , no pulmonary lesion be obtain . further study with both these method must be undertake to ascertain more exactly the sequence of the pathological process . it seem probable that they be identical in each case . the result obtai 
1 . blood glycolysis in vitro during a period of three hour ' incubation proceeds at practically the same rate under sterile condition and when no effort be make to prevent contamination . 2 . fresh thyroid extract , adrenalin , and phlorhizin do not contain any substance which have a constant effect upon the rate of blood glycolysis in vitro during a period of three hour ' incubation proceeds at practically the same rate under sterile condition and when no effort be make to prevent contamination . of the body . no evidence of the presence of a antiferment be find . 
1 . Metchnikoff and Besredka 's living sensitize vaccine produce a typhoid cholecystitis when inject directly into the gall bladder of rabbit . Besredka 's living sensitize vaccine be therefore infectious . 2 . rabbit can not be successfully immunize with this vaccine against direct gall bladder infection . accordingly , rabbit can not be use to test immunity in this way . 3 . the strain use in the Army vaccine be pathogenic , relatively avirulent , and distinctly toxic . the strain use in the Army vaccine efficacy be believe to depend on the strain use in the Army vaccine efficacy toxicity . 4 . vaccination in those who have have typhoid and revaccination produce more severe local reaction than original vaccination in some instance . 5 . the typhoidin skin test be not believe to be a indication of typhoid proteid sensitization , which be not so complete , so permanent , or so specific as true immunity , but rather a indication of typhoid proteid sensitization , which be not so complete , so permanent , or so specific as true immunity . 
such foreign protein as horse serum and egg-white in the amount employ in these experiment do not produce evidence of intoxication immediately after injection into rabbit . single large injection do , however , produce change in the parenchymatous organ after a period often to twenty-one day . these develop at the time or immediately after the animal have form antibody for such foreign protein as horse serum and egg-white in the amount employ in these experiment . the mechanism of the development of the lesion in the myocardium , liver , and kidney of rabbit be thus the mechanism of the development of the lesion in the myocardium , liver , and kidney of rabbit , whether a single inoculation be give or whether repeat inoculation be make in sensitize animal . by the latter method , however , much more marked and extensive change may be produce . 
1 . at least three subgroup of pneumococcus type ii may be recognize by specific immune reaction . they have be call Subgroups II A , II B , and ii X. 2 . that the organism of at least three subgroup of pneumococcus type ii be biologically related to pneumococcus type ii be show by the follow fact : -lrb- a -rrb- agglutination with antipneumococcus serum ii . -lrb- b -rrb- protection with antipneumococcus serum ii , except Subgroup II X. -lrb- c -rrb- absorption of Antipneumococcus serum ii with typical type ii pneumococcus remove the antibody for all subgroup , -lrb- d -rrb- absorption of Antipneumococcus serum ii with a member of Subgroups II A or II B remove only the antibody for the homologous subgroup . absorption of Antipneumococcus serum ii with any give member of subgroup ii x remove the antibody for that particular strain only . 3 . that at least three subgroup of pneumococcus type ii , although biologically related to pneumococcus type ii , possess , nevertheless , specific differential characterswhich separate they one from another , be evidence by thefollow fact : -lrb- a -rrb- the organism of any subgroup be not agglutinate bythe antisera of Subgroups . -lrb- b -rrb- they one from another be not protect against by the serum of Subgroups . -lrb- c -rrb- they one from another do not absorb from Antipneumococcus serum ii the specific immune body of Subgroups . 4 . Subgroups II A II B be characterize by immunity reaction identical within the respective group . 5 . subgroup subgroup ii x consist of heterogeneous strain which do not cross in Subgroups II A , II B , and ii X. 2 immunity reaction with each other or with Subgroups ii Subgroups II A or ii B. 
1 . the spontaneous occurrence of myeloid leukemia of the fowl be confirm 2 . myeloid leukemia of the fowl be transmissible by intravenous or intraperitoneal injection of a organic emulsion . the latter be in confirmation of the work of Ellermann and Bang -lrb- 6 , 7 -rrb- , who first successfully transmit the disease . Ellermann and Bang be follow by Hirschfeld and Jacoby -lrb- 13 -rrb- -rrb- whose successful transmission , however , seem to be limit to a strain which have 13 origin in a fowl present to Ellermann and Bang by Bang . Burckhardt -lrb- 14 , 15 -rrb- likewise transmit the disease , but here again the stock animal come from Hirschfeld and Jacoby -lrb- 13 -rrb- -rrb- whose successful transmission , however , seem to be limit to a strain which have 13 origin in a fowl present to Ellermann and Bang by   Bang and therefore indirectly from Bang . the transmission report above be of special interest , because the transmission report above originate in a animal absolutely unrelated to that of the previous investigator . 
the result here report confirm those of the former papers and strengthen the conclusion draw therefrom . those of the former papers may be summarize as follow : Chicken plasma have a marked bactericidal action on bacillus typhosus , which may be in some slight degree overcome by the presence of   especially splenic tissue especially splenic tissue , in the culture . on bacillus dysenterioe this bactericidal action of Chicken plasma be present , but much less marked , and the same counteract action of   especially splenic tissue , be evident . on bacillus coli verus Chicken plasma have little or this bactericidal action of  Chicken plasma . on bacterium diphtheriticum Chicken plasma have a very strong bactericidal action which may be strongly counteract by the culture . in all case this bactericidal action of  Chicken plasma be decidedly diminish by dilution , as show by the comparative result of these and the culture formerly report . the migrate white cell from splenic culture , or the migrate white cell from splenic culture , have a distinctly bactericidal influence on all organism test except bacillus coli verus . Murphy state that lymphocyte first appear in the general circulation of the chick embryo on the 18th to 20th day , but in my culture of splenic tissue cell resemble lymphocyte in morphology and behavior begin to appear in culture of 11 or 12 20th day spleen and be abundant in culture of spleen from 14 day or older embryo . 
these result seem to indicate that many bacterium may be utilize by tissue cell as food for growth or may contain a substance or substance stimulate cell growth or multiplication . a substance or substance stimulate cell growth or multiplication be stable and be not destroy by heat to 100 degree c. or by long standing . with micrococcus aureus this action be often neutralize or overcome by a substance inhibitory to growth . the nature of these substance have not yet be determine , though several attempt along this line be make by endeavor to split the typhoid bacterial substance accord to the method of Vaughan see pdf for structure and test the poisonous and non-poisonous residue separately . however , at the time too little bacterial substance be use to obtain enough end-product to be of much use , and the product so obtain prevent the plasma from coagulate . even in the uncoagulated plasma there appear to be a increase of cell in the culture with the non-poisonous residue . the author hope to be able to repeat these test with split product at a later time when more bacterial substance be available , with the hope of obtain more definite result . 
in plasma culture , with or without tissue , tubercle bacillus form characteristic streptothrix-like colony of loosely twist skein of thread . in plasma tissue culture embryonal connective tissue and epithelial cell phagocytyze tubercle bacillus freely . splenic tissue culture from fourteen day or older embryo if inoculate with isolate bacillus will phagocytyze and prevent the development of all or nearly all bacillus present . if heavy inoculation of tubercle bacillus with many bacillary clump be make in splenic tissue culture from fourteen day or older embryo if inoculate with isolate bacillus tubercle bacillus with many bacillary clump develop more freely than in similar connective tissue culture from heart tissue in spite of marked phagocytosis . in such culture the first change see be the first change see . the larger cell contain bacillus then fuse to form larger multinuclear cell and these by further fusion form typical giant cell with quiescent nucleus in characteristic grouping and bacillus in degenerate protoplasm away from the nuclear group . the cell may digest these or may be unable to do so , in which case tubercle bacillus with many bacillary clump develop within the cell and eventually cause complete cell degeneration . 
1 . definite morphological change occur in the batonnet of the proximal convoluted tubule in stage of activity . 2 . atypical mitochondrium but the batonnet of the proximal convoluted tubule in stage of activity exist in the regenerated cell find in chronic uranium nephritis . 3 . the secretion of the urea occur in these cell which do not contain the cell organ . 4 . the urea be secrete normally in the proximal convoluted tubule only -lrb- leschke -rrb- . 5 . the urea appear in the form of granule , which be arrange in definite row . 6 . it be suggest that the secretion of the urea be by means of the mitochondrial batonnet which act as condensor . 
we believe that we experiment have show that the serum of rabbit and sheep immunize with culture of treponema pallidum acquire spirochaeticidal property for these culture spirochaete . the normal serum of these animal also possess spirochaeticidal action if use in sufficient quantity , and the action of the immune serum represent probably a increase of the antibody normally present . both normal and immune spirochaeticidal property be destroy by heat to 56 degree c . the spirochaeticidal action of the immune serum can be reactivate by the addition of fresh normal serum of the same species , insufficient in amount to exert a spirochaeticidal effect by a spirochaeticidal effect . the structure of these spirochaeticidal body , therefore , be entirely analogous to that of the well know bactericidal antibody know to exist in antibacterial serum . we do not wish to have these result interpret as apply to virulent spirochaete as well as to these culture spirochaete . a subsequent publication will demonstrate why we specify this at present . 
1 . as regard these strain , at least , there be no consistent change , either increase or decrease , of rabbit pathogenicity during progressive rabbit passage . 2 . there be no difference in pathogenicity between these different strain , although some of they be isolate from condyloma , some from chancre , one from a mucous patch , and one by Nichols from the nervous system . 3 . we do not believe that there be any consistency of difference in speed of incubation between these various strain . 4 . we think that the nature of the lesion produce by any individual strain , and the incubation time as well , be dependent upon the fortuitous factor incident to the nature of the material use , the technique of injection , and the size of rabbit in which the injection be make . as to the tendency to generalize possess by one strain or another , we be not prepare to make a statement . we have not inspect as carefully as we might all we rabbit in regard to the more obscure syphilitic lesion such as small nodule on the eyebrow , nodule on the nasal bone , and internal lesion of the eye . as a matter of fact , we have notice three case of keratitis , probably syphilitic , and a number of preputial metastase , we have see occasional nodule about the anus , and in one case a peritonitis in the fluid of which living treponema be find on examination . there have not be in we series a extensive number of generalization . we attribute this largely to the fact that all the study here record be make on rabbit intratesticularly inoculate . this largely to the fact that all the study here record be make on rabbit intratesticularly inoculate appear from the writings of other investigator that intravenous and intracardial injection of rabbit lead to a more extensive metastatic or general distribution . two of the few rabbit inoculate intravenously show testicular lesion . a series of rabbit intracerebrally inoculate through trephine opening show nothing definite on autopsy , though one of they show interference with reflex and rigidity of the limb for a time which seem significant of pathological change . this rabbit , however , recover entirely . 
although these antibody can be produce by the immunization of animal with cultivate treponema pallidum , and although these antibody exert specific agglutinative and treponemicidal action upon the culture organism , cultivate treponema pallidum possess , at least in the concentration so far obtain by we in rabbit and sheep , practically no action for virulent treponema obtain directly from lesion . there seem to be in the infected body a inability to exert a purely serum action upon the virulent treponema , the virulent treponema . we do not think that this should in any way discourage we further investigation of the protective action of antibody produce with the pallida , the immunization of animal with kill virulent organism , and the antibody in rabbit and sheep and human being during the course of infection and after recovery . on the one hand , the slight occasional agglutination and the lower proportion of take with the concentrated serum in the last experiment at least indicate the possibility that we have be work with the serum and the lower proportion of just as with work with the pneumococcus and other highly invasive organism , a serum of considerable antibody contents must be use before result can be expect . again , a cellular destruction and the healing of lesion which undoubtedly take place in rabbit and sheep , sometimes with surprising speed , may be a cellular destruction , and by inject the serum either locally or intravenously and give the slight occasional agglutination and the lower proportion of time to be absorb by the cell before inject virulent material , better result may be obtain . this direction of research as well as further study on the antagonistic cellular process against the pallida , the immunization of animal with kill virulent organism , and the antibody in rabbit and sheep and human being during the course of infection and after recovery ,  the pallida , the immunization of animal with kill virulent organism , and the antibody in rabbit and sheep and human being during the course of infection and after recovery , the immunization of animal with kill virulent organism , and the antibody in rabbit and sheep and human being during the course of infection and after recovery be be investigate , and we hope to be able to report upon   in the near future . 
cat inject into the parotid gland when present consist chiefly and the testicle can be make to develop a pathological condition have several point of resemblance to the condition present in mumps in human being . after a incubation stage of from five to eight day definite change have be note in the temperature , blood leukocyte , and inoculate organ . the temperature rise begin within twenty-four hour of the inoculation and reach a maximum in from seven to fourteen day . the febrile rise fluctuate between 1 degree and 2.5 degree c . the white blood cell begin to increase on the second day follow the inoculation . a polymorphonuclear leukocytosis which precede the glandular swelling be a polymorphonuclear leukocytosis which precede the glandular swelling . this initial rise be follow by a decline , after which the lymphocyte increase . the increase be confine to the small lymphocyte , which increase to from 7 to 10 per cent of they initial number . the inoculate gland become swollen and tender . the swell and tenderness become apparent from the fifth to the ninth day and persist for a variable period . the parotid change be less constant or less obvious than be the testicular . the latter be constant and endure from eight to twelve day . the rise of temperature and a polymorphonuclear leukocytosis which precede the glandular swelling precede the glandular swell , but all the change reach a maximum at about the same time , after which the glandular swell decline gradually . what may be regard as normal condition be reestablish in four week or less . the intraparotid and intratesticular injection of extract of normal parotid gland and testicle may cause a mild rise of temperature and  a polymorphonuclear leukocytosis which precede the glandular swelling of brief duration , but swell and tenderness be absent . the white cell increase be the white cell increase the white cell increase . the intraparotid and intratesticular injection of filtrate of normal saliva may cause a mild rise of temperature of very brief duration , but leukocytosis , swell , and tenderness do not appear . the histological change in the parotid gland when present consist chiefly of edema of the interlobular connective tissue with mononuclear interstitial infiltration about the duct and elsewhere . in case of long duration the duct may be dilate . but in some instance the swollen gland while show congestion and edema in gross show inconspicuous change under the microscope . the histological change in the testicle be of two kind : the histological change in the testicle . '' the pathological condition set up by the filtrate derive from the salivary secretion of case of acute parotitis be intensify by successive transfer through a small series of cat of the extract and emulsion of the parotid gland and testicle previously inoculate . the pathological change be also prevent or reduce when the extract and emulsion of the parotid gland and testicle previously inoculate be previously incubate with a quantity of blood serum obtain from a cat which have survive inoculation . normal serum , on the other hand , have no such inhibiting effect . the deduction from these experiment be to no such inhibiting effect that   the testicle contain a filterable substance capable of set up a series of definite pathological condition when inoculate into the testicle and parotid gland of cat . whether the specific microbic cause of     the testicle be a microorganism and if so whether the specific microbic cause of     the testicle be the specific microbic cause of   the testicle remain to be ascertain . 
potent antimeningitis serum can be safely produce in the horse by the method of three successive intravenous inoculation of live meningococcus and parameningococcus repeat at state interval . sudden and alarming symptom and sudden death be avoid by employ first a desensitize injection and then by adjust the dose accord to the febrile reaction and by make the highly dilute injection slowly . horse undergo this process of immunization remain in good condition and may even gain in weight . specific immune body appear in the serum early and rise rapidly . by inoculate alternately several strain of live meningococcus and parameningococcus repeat at state interval , and the autolyze product of each , a polyvalent serum of high titer can be produce in 8 to 12 week instead of in the 10 month require by the subcutaneous method . the serum produce by this rapid method have be employ therapeutically in America , England , France , and some other country . it be highly desirable to isolate meningococcus from many source and test several strain of live   meningococcus and parameningococcus repeat at state interval against a polyvalent serum of high titer . strain which be not agglutinate in high dilution in such a serum should be include subsequently in the lot of strain use for immunization . 
the subcutaneous , intraperitoneal , or intravenous inoculation of culture of typhoid bacillus do not cause , as far as could be determine , a decrease in the antibody content of the blood serum of the rabbit . on the other hand , typhoid bacillus cause a rapid mobilization of normal antibody , thus increase they concentration in the blood , to be follow somewhat later , as in the other form of inoculation , by the production of so call acquire antibody . no such condition as the negative phase of Wright be discover , although especially look for in the experiment . 
we have find in the kidney of twelve supposedly normal guinea pig , come from Pennsylvania and New Jersey , a parasite that closely resemble in some of New Jersey phase Klossiella muri , describe by Smith and Johnson , and the renal parasite of the two west african guinea pig , describe by seidelin . the form most commonly find by we and describe as the sporoblast cycle , be evidently similar to those describe by Smith and Johnson and by Seidelin . there be certain discrepancy of measurement between Seidelin and the one here describe , but the most important difference between the two be the most important difference between the two . Seidelin have find thirty sporozoite ; we have find from eight to twelve , while eight be eight . further , we have find a ring form which be unlike any of the stage in either the sporoblast or schizogonic cycle , and which we interpret tentatively as the male element or microgamete . in addition , we have find a tubular form which resemble the glomerular body of Klossiella muri and which we think be the schizogonic phase of the renal parasite of the two west african guinea pig , describe by seidelin . 
1 . the process of repair in the kidney of guinea pig after sublethal dose of certain arsenical compound indicate that all arsenical do not produce a purely vascular type of renal injury . 2 . while some arsenical produce a predominantly vascular injury and other produce a predominantly tubular injury , both these tissue element be undoubtedly always affect , although in vary proportion . in addition , the interstitial connective tissue be probably always affect . the diffuse proliferation of the interstitial connective tissue may be relatively conspicuous in the process of repair in the kidney of guinea pig after sublethal dose of certain arsenical compound after arsenical that cause but slight vascular injury . 3 . all red kidney do not necessarily show identical picture during the process of repair in the kidney of guinea pig after sublethal dose of certain arsenical compound ; the same be true of pale kidney . 4 . the mode of action of a arsenical compound as a renal toxic agent be bind up with the chemical constitution of a arsenical compound as a renal toxic agent . 
the poliomyelitic virus obtain from a experimental monkey have be pass through eight generation in rabbit . the poliomyelitic virus obtain from a experimental monkey show no sign of die out . on the other hand , the other hand give no evidence of become more pathogenic to the species through successive passage . the incubation period remain variable and the percentage of take have not increase . whether eventually a virus can be obtain which be of heighten virulence to rabbit be problematic . all inoculation be by no means successful . the animal show great individual difference in susceptibility to a virus , as be evidence by the fact that out of fifty-four rabbit inoculate , only twenty-two , or about 40 per cent , succumb . the fact that out of fifty-four rabbit inoculate may explain the negative result of other investigator . at several point in the series of experiment it be think that the strain have die out . as many as six rabbit have be inoculate one after the other before a virus would catch again . the age of many as six rabbit be important in consider the susceptibility . from the limited datum at we command , adult rabbit be resistant , and there appear to be a abrupt increase in resistance between the age of 6 week ; 6 be , rabbit under 6 week be more susceptible to a virus . there seem to be a parallel between the age incidence of this disease in rabbit and spontaneous poliomyelitis in man . spontaneous poliomyelitis in man be indicate by the term `` infantile paralysis . '' several method of inoculation have prove successful ; thus many as six rabbit have succumb as a result of introduce a virus directly into the brain , by inject a result of introduce  a virus directly into the brain into a peripheral nerve , or directly into the circulation , or by place a result of introduce  a virus directly into the brain upon the uninjured nasal mucosa . the symptom produce show more or less departure from the symptom of spontaneous poliomyelitis in man as see in this disease in rabbit and spontaneous poliomyelitis in man and in the experimental disease in a experimental monkey . there be two distinct picture recognizable . in one there be paralysis of one or more of the extremity which progress until death , resemble somewhat the symptom of the experimental disease in  a experimental monkey . this we have designate the progressive type . the other group be include in what this we have call the fulminate type . the symptom be explosive in character , with extreme weakness amounting to prostration , terminate in death in a few hour , attendant upon respiratory failure . the mode of inoculation seem to have little effect upon the type of symptom produce . the incubation period be variable and apparently do not depend upon the method of inoculation . the incubation period vary from 2 to 41 day , with a average of 12 day . the two extreme both occur after intracranial injection . after intranasal insufflation the incubation period be short , be in each case 2 to 41 day , follow by symptom of the fulminate type . the placing of the virus into the nose seem to be a effective method , but be as uncertain as other route , as only three out of nine rabbit test in this manner succumb . the disease produce by this route be particularly virulent . a virus show no tendency to become fix . the incubation period be as variable in the eighth generation as in the first , and a virus have show no tendency to become fix towards increase virulence through successive passage , in these respects differ from the virus of rabies . we have find the virus to be filterable . a emulsion of the central nervous matter of a rabbit of the first generation pass through a Berkefeld filter , and inject intracerebrally into another rabbit , result in death , precede by symptom of   the fulminate type . virus -lrb- unfiltered -rrb- from a rabbit of the first generation pass through a Berkefeld filter , and inject intracerebrally into another rabbit be transfer successfully to two other rabbit . the lesion , while definite and consistent throughout the series of experiment , lack the distinctive feature of the pathologic picture of spontaneous poliomyelitis in man in man and a experimental monkey . capillary congestion , punctate hemorrhage , degeneration of the motor cell , satellitosis , and more or less cellular infiltration of the gray matter of the cord and medullum be find , but perivascular infiltration i 
the problem of eradicate ovarian infection in the domestic fowl assume still greater importance than heretofore , in the light of datum recently acquire . not only be the problem of eradicate ovarian infection in the domestic fowl assume still greater importance than heretofore , in the light of datum , but also because they constitute a possible source of danger to man . Eggs which harbor   in the yolk in large number may produce abnormal condition , when feed , not only in young chick , but in adult fowl , young rabbit , guinea pig , and kitten . the infection usually result in the death of the animal be most pronounced , the infection usually result in the death of the animal . in kitten the most prominent symptom be the most prominent symptom with member of the paratyphoid group of bacterium . the possibility of infected egg cause serious disturbance in young child and in the sick and convalescent of all age must therefore receive serious consideration . ovarian infection of be very common throughout this country . hence , a large proportion of the market egg be infect with   . when such egg be allow to remain in nest under broody hen , or in warm storage place , for comparatively few hour , young child contain large number of the organism . soft boil , coddling , and fry on one side only do not necessarily render the yolk free from viable bacterium ; therefore , egg which have go through these process may , like raw egg , be the cause of serious disturbance in person who be particularly susceptible to such influence , and especially to infant . that no well authenticate instance of egg-poisoning of this kind be on record do not warrant the assumption that there have be no case . the etiology of infantile stomach and intestinal disturbance be as yet too little understand ; in fact , the etiology of infantile stomach and intestinal disturbance may be say that many of these disorder have no known cause , and almost as much may be say regard gastro-intestinal disease in later life . furthermore , since the ailment cause by infected egg cause serious disturbance in young child and in the sick and convalescent of all age would not make many of these disorder feel presumably until several day after many of these disorder ingestion , little or no suspicion would fall upon infected egg cause serious disturbance in young child and in the sick and convalescent of all age . it may be say , too , that the wide distribution of ovarian infection in the domestic fowl have come about only in the last few year , hence the wide distribution of ovarian infection in   the domestic fowl possible danger to man be one of recent development . 
1 . in thyroparathyroidectomized dog the onset of tetany bear no constant relation to the ferment-antiferment balance of the serum . 2 . the serum lipase titer remain at a low level throughout . 3 . a progressive increase in non-coagulable nitrogen and proteose be observe in the serum follow the removal of the gland . 4 . the amino nitrogen of the serum be usually increase at the time when tetany be most marked . 
1 . as have be find by other investigator , when a large amount of dextrose be inject intravenously into a normal dog a large amount of dextrose disappear from the circulate blood in about 90 minute after the end of the injection . varying amount -lrb- a average of 60 per cent -rrb- be excrete in the urine . 2 . even in nephrectomized animal the same quantity will leave the circulation in the same length of time as in normal animal . 3 . this phenomenon seem to be , at least to a great extent , independent of vital process , since dextrose , after intravenous injection into dead animal , be find to leave the circulate blood in about 90 minute after the end of the injection rapidly . 4 . this phenomenon be independent of the important abdominal organ , for this phenomenon also occur in animal -lrb- living or dead -rrb- in which the aorta and inferior vena cava have be ligate near the diaphragm , thus abolish most of the circulation posterior to the diaphragm . 5 . the fact that a considerable amount of the sugar pass from the circulation in the same length of time into the surrounding tissue be establish by find a increase in the carbohydrate of the muscle tissue . this be do in the case of the living anterior animal and in the whole and anterior dead animal . in most of these experiment there be also evidence of the formation of polysaccharide in the muscle tissue . 
1 . by means of vascular suture it be possible to remove the dog 's kidney from the body and later to restore the dog 's kidney to the dog 's kidney former position . 2 . such a kidney be remove from the control of the nervous system , at least for a time . 3 . examination of the function of a kidney so treated show a initial period of overaction , as compare with that of the normal kidney . 4 . this be follow by balanced action . 5 . the more recent test of renal function show that a single , reimplant kidney be able to maintain normal life indefinitely . 6 . the result of these experiment , together with the evidence already at hand , suggest strongly that secretory nerve to a kidney do not exist . 
individual , living , tissue cell can be obtain in suspension by digest with trypsin the clot of grow tissue culture . under these circumstance the living cell assume a spherical form . when wash and plate in fresh plasma they put out process and proliferate . after growth in the new plate have occur the digestion and plating can be repeat . the limit of the method have not yet be reach . we be at work on a number of the problem which the method have open up . 
pure culture of the spirochaetal causative agent of the disease know as Weil 's disease , or febrile icterus , in Japan , have be obtain by we in a solid , a semisolid , and a fluid medium . the spirochaeta thus isolate remain pathogenic for guinea pig for many generation . up to the present time we have succeed through the courtesy of Professor Nagayo , Dr. Konuma , and Dr. Ishihara , in cultivate three different strain . a facultative anaerobe be a facultative anaerobe . the solid and semisolid culture media possess one disadvantage , in that Professor Nagayo , Dr. Konuma , and Dr. Ishihara be opaque on account of the addition of red blood corpuscle ; but it be hope that this drawback may soon be overcome by further study . we shall report later the result of investigation regard various question in immunity as well as further detail regard the biological property of a facultative anaerobe . 
by the addition of substitute benzyl halide to hexamethylenetetramine , a series of quaternary salt of this base be obtain . quaternary salt of this base represent a new group of organic bactericide . the result obtain in the test with these substance upon bacillus typhosus have demonstrate the existence of direct relationship between chemical constitution and bactericidal action within a series of quaternary salt of this base . the bactericidal character be directly attributable to the presence of the hexamethylenetetramine nucleus . the degree of the bactericidal action , however , be determine by the position , character , and number of the group substitute in the benzene nucleus . by the introduction of the methyl , chlorine , bromine , iodine , cyano , and nitro group into the benzene nucleus of the parent benzyl hexamethylenetetraminium salt , the bactericidal power of this compound be notably enhance . the substitution of these group in the ortho position almost invariably result in substance which be more active than these group in the ortho position meta or para isomer . the introduction of the methoxy group be without marked effect . several substance in which two hexamethylenetetraminium side-chain occur be find to be the most active of the substance of a series of quaternary salt of this base when test against bacillus typhosus . comparative test with other bacterial type demonstrate that these compound possess a marked degree of specificity for bacillus typhosus . 
the extension of the study of the quaternary salt of the hexamethylenetetramine have demonstrate that the introduction of the hexamethylenetetramine nucleus in this manner result in the production of bactericidal substance or enhance the bactericidal action if already present . in particular it be find possible by the use of 2 , xch -lrb- 2 -rrb- 2 , as a connect link , to furnish hydrocarbon of the most varied character with the hexamethylenetetramine molecule and hydrocarbon of the most varied character with the hexamethylenetetramine molecule , hydrocarbon of the most varied character with the hexamethylenetetramine molecule , and hydrocarbon of the most varied character with the hexamethylenetetramine molecule and to study the relation between chemical constitution and bactericidal action in the series of the substance . because of the variety of chemical type study , the result be too involve for a detailed summary here . many of the substance be find to be very powerful bactericide , and in a number of instance derivative of purely aliphatic nature be find to possess a unusual bactericidal power . bacillus typhosus , streptococcus , meningococcus , and gonococcus be bacillus typhosus , streptococcus , meningococcus , and gonococcus , and striking instance of partial specificity be observe . this specificity be find to favor not one species alone , but striking instance of partial specificity be find in which each of the type of bacillus be show to be especially susceptible to one or another of the particular type of compound employ . the source of this partial specificity be to be seek not in the source of this partial specificity but in the molecule to which the hexamethylenetetramine nucleus in this manner be attach . the action of some of the substance be test in the presence of serum or protein and be find to be not at all or only slightly inhibit . in other case marked inhibition occur . the factor control the serum - or protein-compatibility of the substance be likewise to be seek in that portion of the molecule other than the hexamethylenetetramine . 
1 . live phagocyte be able to protect ingest organism from the action of destructive substance in the surround fluid , and even from a strong homologous antiserum . 2 . there be evidence that the protection by live phagocyte be largely if not entirely condition on they be alive . 3 . these fact should be take into consideration in the study of disease cause by infectious agent capable of live within tissue cell . 
digitali be give by mouth to five normal young male adult in amount range from 2.0 to 3.0 gm . of standardized leaf in the course of 7 to 10 day . the as-vs interval be prolong in four of the five subject , the greatest prolongation occur in the case of the subject who receive the most digitali and none at all in one who receive only 2.0 gm . there be the greatest prolongation occur in the case of the subject who receive the most digitali and none at all in one who receive only 2.0 gm to so great a interval as 0.2 second until 2.7 gm . have be take . the effect of the digitali on conduction time begin 5 to 6 day after the drug have be start and after 1.5 to 1.8 gm . have be take . the effect of the digitali on conduction time persist for 1 to 2 week after the drug have be stop . atropine remove completely the effect of digitali on a-v conduction . the slow heart rate after exercise be accompany by a enhancement of the defect in conduction . the change in conduction through digitali be therefore almost entirely , if not entirely , due to increase of vagal tone and irritability . digitali do not affect to a appreciable extent the q-end of s and the q-end of t interval . exercise and atropine both shorten the ventricular complex q-end of t while the subject who receive the most digitali and none at all in one who receive only 2.0 gm be under digitali . the amplitude of the t wave , therefore , especially in lead ii , be change within 48 hour after digitali have be start , a decrease then begin which become greater as the drug be continue and which persist until 10 to 19 day after the digitali on conduction time have be stop . the change in the t deflection precede by several day the change in conduction time . the t wave , therefore , therefore , in the normal subject as well as in the patient give we the earliest indication of digitali action . the amplitude of p , Q , R , and s be not materially influence by the amount of digitali give . the pulse rate in two subject become lower than usual at night as the result of the digitali on conduction time ; otherwise there be no evidence of vagal action on the sino-auricular node . blood pressure be uninfluenced by the digitali on conduction time . mild subjective sensation occur in all the subject during the administration of the drug . a curious , hitherto undescribed , digitali arrhythmium consist of block auricular premature beat occur in one subject after mouth to five normal young male adult in amount range from 2.0 to 3.0 gm . the digitali on conduction time have be take . 
1 . the hypodermic administration of tethelin increase markedly the rate of growth of the primary tumor and the tendency to form metastase in rat inoculate with carcinoma , in this , as in other respects , reproduce the action of the whole anterior lobe of the pituitary body . 2 . other alcohol-soluble extractive of the pituitary body , with the exception of the lecithin fraction , exert no appreciable effect upon the growth of carcinoma in rat inoculate with carcinoma . 3 . the lecithin fraction , as in previously report experiment in which we employ lecithin obtain from egg , cause evident retardation of the growth of carcinoma in rat inoculate with carcinoma . 
these experiment justify the follow general conclusion . by the intravenous injection of m/4 magnesium sulphate into dog at a certain rate , a stage can be reach where the abdominal wall be completely relax and when section of the abdomen and stimulation of sensitive part of the parietal peritoneum do not produce pain or elicit any reaction of the animal . at the same time spontaneous respiration may still be maintain within normal limit and the lid reflex be fair or even normal . in a stage intratracheal intubation for artificial respiration can be easily accomplish . a stage may be attain in 12 to 14 minute when the rate of injection be about 3 cc . per minute . when a stage be once attain the rate of injection should gradually be reduce , otherwise , sooner or later , spontaneous respiration will be abolish , and by a further maintenance of the rate of injection all the skeletal muscle may become paralyzed . when the intravenous injection of m/4 magnesium sulphate into dog at a certain rate be continue for a longer period , the paralytic effect of the intravenous injection of m/4 magnesium sulphate into dog at a certain rate will set in , even when administer at a slow rate . the paralysis of the respiratory function be readily meet by intrapharyngeal insufflation , which be easily execute even without training in this procedure , or by the method of intratracheal insufflation , if execute by one train in training in this procedure management . when the respiration of the animal be accomplish by insufflation , the paralytic effect of the magnesium may be abolish fairly rapidly by a intravenous injection of about 10 cc . of a m/8 calcium chloride solution ; or a m/8 calcium chloride solution may disappear slowly , after the infusion of the magnesium solution be discontinue for some time . the latter mode of disappearance may be favorably accelerate by a intravenous infusion of 60 to 100 cc . of a m/4 solution of sodium sulphate . the production of anesthesia by intravenous injection of m/4 magnesium sulphate into dog at a certain rate should not be undertake unless a apparatus for intrapharyngeal insufflation be at hand , because in exceptional case the disappearance of spontaneous respiration may be one of the earliest consequence of the intravenous injection of m/4 magnesium sulphate into dog at a certain rate . the injection of calcium chloride should not be employ in case in which the subject show cardiac insufficiency . in such instance , moreover , injection of magnesium should not be use for the purpose of anesthesia ; at least not until greater experience have be acquire in the employment of the method of intratracheal insufflation . 
the foregoing experiment establish firmly the follow fact . Subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of sodium oxalate in subtoxic dose , when administer to a animal which receive a subminimal dose of magnesium sulphate , produce profound anesthesia and paralysis of long duration , although the usual effect of sodium oxalate in subtoxic dose alone be of a stimulate character . the more noteworthy be , in general , in harmony with the result report by starkenstein who , however , seem to have use the combination of the two salt in one solution ; namely , that of magnesium oxalate . the combined injection of subminimal dose of sodium oxalate and magnesium sulphate produce a strong reduction , or even , at time , a complete abolition of the conductivity of the motor nerve ending . a intravenous injection of calcium salt bring on a recovery from the profound and prolonged effect of the combined action of sodium oxalate and magnesium sulphate , which be as prompt as be observe in we experiment . the more noteworthy be the more noteworthy , since depression of long duration produce by prolonged continuous injection of magnesium solution alone do not respond very promptly and effectively to calcium injection . as will be recall , the start point for we investigation be the start point for we investigation that substance which be capable of precipitate calcium-a biological antagonist of magnesium-ought to be capable of increase the depressive effect of magnesium . we experiment prove that this assumption be correct . this would seem , therefore , to justify the interpretation that the augment action of sodium oxalate in subtoxic dose have the augment action of  sodium oxalate in subtoxic dose cause in the ability of the latter to precipitate calcium and thus increase within the body the amount of unantagonized magnesium . however , we wish to state expressly that this view be , for the present , still no more than a hypothesis and do not exclude other possible interpretation of we firmly the follow fact . as we point out this view speak against a hypothesis that oxalate do not produce phenomenon of depression ; the toxic symptom produce by oxalate exhibit distinctly sign of increase and not of decrease irritability . 
in as far as the observation report have a bearing on the movement of fluid within the eye , they be , for the most part , in accord with view at present generally accept . on the other hand , we know of no other way in which the other hand may be so readily demonstrate that simple and even temporary local circulatory change may profoundly alter the distribution of substance from the circulate blood to the extravascular fluid and tissue . in the light of the observation , the light of  the observation would seem that such change might easily account for marked idiosyncrasy in the action of poisonous drug , and as well probably for other factor in drug action . 
claim of efficiency have be make at two widely separated period for the chemical treatment of epidemic meningitis , in the first instance for lysol and in the second for protargol . the use of lysol be long since abandon ; the recommendation for protargol be base on a single series of case , small in number . because of the variable severity of epidemic of meningitis , small reliance can be place on result of treatment limit in extent to small number of case and to one locality . a more uniform and accurate measure of the value of a method of treatment be provide by these animal . Young guinea pig respond in a definite manner to intraperitoneal inoculation of virulent meningococcus . Protargol nor lysol prove to have any curative action on the experimental infection thus produce in these animal . monkey respond in a characteristic manner to the inoculation of virulent culture into the subarachnoid space . Protargol display no curative action on the experimental infection thus produce in these animal . on the contrary , both lysol and protargol exert antileukotactic and antiphagocytic effect , and be also potent protoplasmic poison , and the leukocyte with which both lysol and protargol come in contact be injure and make to degenerate . accord to the extent to which these harmful property be exert , the chemical promote the advance rather than restrain the progress of meningococcic infection . recovery from meningococcic infection in man and animal be accomplish chiefly through the process of phagocytosis . the specific antiserum act curatively by increase the emigration of the leukocyte with which both lysol and protargol come in contact , by promote phagocytosis directly , and by agglutinate virulent meningococcus , and also by neutralize endotoxin . any means which interfere with and reduce these essential process retard or prevent recovery . both lysol and protargol interfere with and diminish the emigration of the leukocyte with which both lysol and protargol come in contact , by promote phagocytosis directly and the phagocytosis of meningococcus , and neither possess antitoxic power . the mixture of antiserum with lysol and with protargol reduce to a certain extent the antileukotactic and antiphagocytic effect of the chemical ; but no curative action be insufficient to set aside wholly the injurious effect which both lysol and protargol produce . it follow , therefore , that whatever theoretical advantage might accrue from a bactericidal activity exert by these chemical independently of the type of meningococcus cause epidemic meningitis , be more than offset by the harmful effect which both lysol and protargol cause . hence specific antiserum seem to provide the logical therapeutic agent with which to combat epidemic meningitis , since a bactericidal activity exert by these chemical independently of the type of meningococcus cause epidemic meningitis be a bactericidal activity exert by these chemical independently of the type of meningococcus cause epidemic meningitis innocuous and promote these essential process essential to recovery from the disease . the problem up to the present have be that of produce a antiserum which represent the several type of the meningococcus , and the problem up to the present be now in a fair way to be solve . 
since a knowledge of the susceptibility of any species of Anopheles to infection with malaria parasite be of great importance in determine a knowledge of the susceptibility of any species of Anopheles to infection with malaria parasite part in the transmission of malaria , the experiment report here be undertake , and include the three most prevalent species of this genus occur in the United States . as a result of the experiment report here Anopheles to infection with malaria parasite Anopheles to infection with malaria parasite be show to be a efficient host of the organism of tertian and estivo-autumnal malaria , Anopheles to infection with malaria parasite crucian of estivo-autumnal malaria , at least , and information have be obtain upon the relative susceptibility of these two species and Anopheles to infection with malaria parasite . the latter species have be know to be a efficient host since Thayer 's experiment in 1900 , and have be consider to be the principal species concern in the transmission of malaria in the United States . with Anopheles to infection with malaria parasite Anopheles to infection with malaria parasite , developmental form of the exogenous or sporogenic cycle of plasmodium vivax , 85 per cent of each species be demonstrate in six -lrb- 85 per cent -rrb- of the seven mosquito dissect , and the development of plasmodium falciparum , in four -lrb- 20 per cent -rrb- of twenty specimen . these four -lrb- 20 per cent -rrb- of twenty specimen infection , however , occur in a series of thirteen specimen feed on one person , so that the percentage be actually 33 . with Anopheles to infection with malaria parasite crucian of estivo-autumnal malaria , oocyst or sporozoite or both oocyst and sporozoite of plasmodium falciparum be find in nine -lrb- 75 per cent -rrb- of the twelve specimen dissect . no test be make with this species and plasmodium vivax . Anopheles to infection with malaria parasite Anopheles to infection with malaria parasite be employ as a control species in Thayer 's experiment and become infected in the follow ratio : eight -lrb- 66 per cent -rrb- of twelve specimen with plasmodium vivax , 85 per cent of each species , and three -lrb- 15 per cent -rrb- of nineteen specimen with plasmodium falciparum . in determine the relative susceptibility of the three most prevalent species of this genus occur in the United States only those individual which have feed upon the same gamete carrier be consider . the number of mosquito from which the percentage be compute be too small to make the result entirely conclusive , but the indication be that Anopheles to infection with malaria parasite punctipenni and Anopheles to infection with malaria parasite quadrimaculatus be equally susceptible to infection with 85 per cent of each species , 85 per cent of each species under the same condition be positive . with plasmodium falciparum , Anopheles to infection with malaria parasite crucian of estivo-autumnal malaria show the highest percentage of infection -lrb- 75 per cent -rrb- , Anopheles to infection with malaria parasite punctipenni second -lrb- 33 per cent -rrb- , and Anopheles to infection with malaria parasite Anopheles to infection with malaria parasite . 
intestinal obstruction , as a rule , be associate with a increase amount of non-coagulable nitrogen in the blood . with acute intoxication the rise in non-coagulable nitrogen may be rapid and reach as high as three or even ten time normal . with more chronic intoxication there may be little or no rise in the blood non-coagulable nitrogen . closed intestinal loop show exactly the same picture , and , when combine with obstruction , may give very high nitrogen reading . acute proteose intoxication due to injection of a pure proteose will show a prompt rise in the blood non-coagulable nitrogen , the blood non-coagulable nitrogen per cent within 3 or 4 hour . these intoxication also show a high blood content of creatinine and urea . the residual or undetermined nitrogen may be very high . a human case of intestinal obstruction with autopsy present blood finding exactly similar to those observe in practically all these experiment . clinically the blood non-coagulable nitrogen may give information of value in intestinal obstruction . a high reading mean a grave intoxication , but a low reading may be observe in some fatal case and give no assurance that a fatal intoxication may not supervene . the kidney in practically all these experiment be normal in all respects . it be possible that protein or tissue destruction rather than impaired eliminative function be responsible for the rise in non-coagulable nitrogen of the blood in these acute intoxication . transfusion of dextrose solution often benefit intestinal obstruction , and may depress the level of the blood non-coagulable nitrogen . some case show no change in non-coagulable nitrogen follow transfusion of dextrose solution and diuresis , and , as a rule , such case present the most severe intoxication . 
1 . in experimental wound , make by remove various size piece of skin from the frog , there be a rapid coagulation of the blood plasma and lymph to form a coagulation tissue which fill the wound cavity . 2 . the observation on the living animal show that a rapid coagulation of the blood plasma and lymph to form a coagulation tissue which fill the wound cavity a grave intoxication , but a low reading may be observe in some fatal case and give no assurance that a fatal intoxication may not supervene . the kidney in practically all these experiment be normal in all respects . it be possible that protein or tissue destruction rather than impaired eliminative function be responsible for the rise in non-coagulable nitrogen of the blood in these acute intoxication . transfusion of dextrose solution often benefit intestinal obstruction , and may depress the level of the non-coagulable nitrogen in the blood in these acute intoxication . some case show no change in non-coagulable nitrogen follow transfusion of dextrose solution and diuresis , and , as a rule , such case present the most severe intoxication . 
in the precede page we have submit evidence which show that a simple intratracheal injection of a solution in a normally breathe rabbit penetrate within a few seconds to the alveolus , chiefly those of the leave lower lobe ; that absorption be rapid and well maintain ; and that the procedure may be repeat effectively a number of time even with a substance like adrenalin which decrease absorption . it be also show that absorption of adrenalin from the lung could be obtain at a time when double the dose give intramuscularly exert no blood pressure effect whatever , and that absorption could still take place after the development of pulmonary edema , when there be a undoubted dilution of the inject solution with a serum-containing liquid and when a diminution of the absorptive field have occur . the inject solution with a serum-containing liquid , after reach the alveolus , be probably largely take up by the capillary of the pulmonary vein . this be indicate by the great rapidity with which a intratracheal injection of adrenalin may cause a rise of blood pressure . in numerous instance , for example , blood pressure begin to rise less than 5 seconds after the completion of a injection , equal and even surpass in rapidity of effect a intramuscular injection . absorption by the lymphatic probably play a secondary part , a assumption render all themore likely if we consider that lymph node be interpolate in the lymphatic pulmonary path , where the bed of the lymph stream become greatly widen and the current slow . injection into the lung , however , offer another advantage due to the vascular arrangement of the absorb field which could be of value therapeutically . absorption of liquid inject into the lung probably take place largely through the capillary of the pulmonary vein ; to a slight extent possibly through the capillary of the bronchial vein which empty partly into the pulmonary vein , partly into the azygo vein ; and probably some absorption occur also through the lymphatic . by far the larger proportion of the absorb material will thus be rapidly deliver to the left auricle and then to the left ventricle . at each succeed systole , as long as absorption continue , a fraction of the drug will be drive into the coronary artery and be able to affect the musculature of the cardiac pump . this fact ought to render the procedure of intratracheal injection a valuable method when it become imperative to stimulate a suddenly fail heart as promptly as possible by drug of the digitali group . intratracheal injection be perhaps better under the condition mention than the intravenous route , for the surface vein can not always be enter with promptness and certainty even under fairly normal condition , and in case of cardiac weakness the difficulty will be measurably increase , while a intratracheal injection can be carry out with ease . moreover , it be legitimate to expect that some absorption will take place from the lung alveolus as long as the heart-lung circulation persist , no matter how feebly , and that thus some of the drug will reach the heart to act on this structure some of  the drug more promptly perhaps than when the drug be administer successfully through the surface vein . as far as the intramuscular route be concern , we have show that a intratracheal injection of adrenalin give prompt though diminish absorption at a time when double the dose give intramuscularly exert no blood pressure effect whatever . the technical difficulty of give a intratracheal injection in animal be slight . Tracheotomy as practise by we in the present series of experiment be not necessary , for a intratracheal injection may be give into the intact trachea without exposure of the intact trachea . the hypodermic needle be insert through the skin about 1 cm . below the larynx in a slanting caudad direction ; the entrance of the needle into the intact trachea be readily feel . a intratracheal injection should not be so rapid that the inject solution with a serum-containing liquid fill the entire tracheal luman , but a intratracheal injection should flow down the side of the intact trachea . if the lum 
the repeat intravenous injection of rabbit with live bacillus coli communior over long period have result in the formation of amyloid deposit in the spleen , liver , and the kidney also . suppurative lesion be not present in most case and therefore not a factor in a factor production . the result have be constant in that amyloid be find in all rabbit , eight in number , which be inject over a period of 88 day or more . these eight in number rabbit show amyloid in the spleen , six of these in the kidney also , and three in the liver . the kidney of these eight in number rabbit also show as a result of the injection a subacute and chronic glomerulitis , parenchymatous degeneration , some interstitial infiltration with round cell , and a slight cellular proliferation of connective tissue , thus resemble the chronic parenchymatous nephritis of man which be so commonly associate with amyloid disease . 
it must be assume that some cause be operative in certain case prevent the healing of defect in the gastric mucosa and be inoperative in other . even though anhemolytic streptococcus be present in practically all gastric ulcer , we can not convince we that these organism have be prove as yet to be the factor which either initiate the ulceration or prevent healing . nevertheless , the constant presence of streptococcus in this type of lesion be the constant presence of streptococcus in this type of lesion and further experiment to determine other significance be be undertake . 
in a stock culture of the hog-cholera bacillus , which be pass through a series of rabbit 14 year ago , a organism be find that differ from the original culture in that a stock culture of the hog-cholera bacillus , which be pass through a series of rabbit 14 year ago fail to form gas from the carbohydrate that be usually attack by a organism , while acid formation persist . this new strain be agglutinate by a anti-hog-cholera bacillus serum and produce in rabbit and mouse a disease similar to that cause by the typical culture . the failure to form gas have persist over a period of 18 month and all attempt to cause the strain to revert to the original condition have fail . the failure to form gas have persist over a period of 18 month and all attempt to cause the strain to revert to the original condition resemble in many respects bacillus typhosus and the failure to form gas have persist over a period of 18 month and all attempt to cause the strain to revert to the original condition may be that non-gas-producing paratyphoid be non-gas-producing paratyphoid . attempt to produce a similar change in a more recently isolate culture of bacillus by means of animal passage and change in the environment have be negative . 
1 . respiratory infection of rabbit with bacillus bovisepticus -lrb- snuffle -rrb- be favor by chill the animal after snuffle have be accustom to heat . 2 . the character of this disease , which occur frequently in rabbit under natural condition , make the application of the experimental result to similar respiratory condition in man less open to objection than in similar experiment with other infection . 3 . the weight of experimental evidence , include we own , do not justify the elimination of exposure to cold as a possible though secondary factor in the incidence of acute respiratory disease . 4 . from the limited datum of we last two experiment it be suggest that any marked change of temperature predispose rabbit under natural condition to this infection , the severity of which vary with the amount of change , and that a change from low to high temperature have a even more marked effect than that from high to low . 
Red corpuscle with nucleus contain heterogeneous sheep antigen when the organ of the same animal possess the same animal . the serum in question contain not only heterogeneous hemolysin but also heterogeneous agglutinin . the hemolytic serum of rabbit immunize with hen red corpuscle be toxic to guinea pig and kill heterogeneous hemolysin , the clinical picture be that of anaphylactic shock . heterogeneous hemolysin be obtain by means of non-toxic antigen -lrb- hen hen red corpuscle inject into vein of rabbit immunize with hen red corpuscle -rrb- . this fact refute the theory of Friedberger , who attribute the antigenic power of a suspension of the organ of the same animal to the antigenic power of a suspension of the organ of the same animal toxic character . 
the intravenous injection of horse serum , keep for 2 hour at 38 degree c. in the presence of one-fifth of horse serum volume of a suspension of 0.5 per cent agar in physiological salt solution and then separate from cent agar by centrifugalization and filtration , produce in normal rabbit in adequate dose a considerable and prolonged fall in the blood pressure , expulsion of fece , a diminish coagulability in the carotid blood , and at time accelerate respiration ; time be , the various symptom observe after the intravenous injection of horse serum in a seroanaphylactized rabbit . horse serum previously keep for 30 minute at 56 degree c. and then treat with agar in the manner describe above , when inject intravenously into a normal rabbit will have no more effect on the arterial pressure , on the intestinal movement , on the respiratory rate , or the coagulation of arterial blood than the introduction of horse serum into the vein of a normal rabbit . 
1 . a partially occluded artery may dilate distal to the site of the constriction . 2 . the dilation be circumscribe . 3 . when the constriction have be either slight in amount or complete , dilation have not be observe . 4 . the dilation be greatest when the luman of the artery -lrb- the aorta -rrb- be reduce to one-third or perhaps one-fourth of the luman of the artery -lrb- the aorta -rrb- original size -lrb- fig. 8 and 11 -rrb- . 5 . dilation or aneurysm of the subclavian artery have be observe twenty-seven or more time in case of cervical rib . 6 . dilation or aneurysm of the subclavian artery be circumscribe , be distal to the point of constriction , and strikingly resemble the dilation which we have produce experimentally . 7 . the genesis of the experimental dilation and of the subclavian dilation occur with cervical rib be probably the genesis of the experimental dilation and of the subclavian dilation occur with cervical rib . 8 . when the aorta be considerably constrict the systolic pressure may be permanently so lowered and the diastolic pressure so increase that the pulse pressure be greatly diminish . 9 . the experimentally produce dilation and the aneurysm of the subclavian artery in case of cervical rib be probably not due to vasomotor paralysis , trauma , or sudden variation in blood pressure . 10 . the abnormal , whirlpool-like play of the blood in the relatively dead pocket just below the site of the constriction , and the lowered pulse pressure may be the chief factor concern in the production of the experimentally produce dilation . 11 . intimal surface bring , however gently , in contact by band or ligature do not , in we experience , unite by first intention , for the force necessary to occlude the subclavian artery in    case of cervical rib be sufficient to cause necrosis of the arterial wall . 12 . band or ligature , roll ever so tightly , do not rupture the intima . 13 . the death of the arterial wall have be bring about by the pressure of the band , a gradual substitution of the necrotic tissue take place , the new vessel penetrate the death of   the arterial wall from both end . the death of   the arterial wall be , I believe , in this manner that a artery become occluded , and it be thus that a fibrous cord form within the constrict band . 
1 . the correct interpretation of the form describe by Stephens under the name of plasmodium tenue be as follow : the correct interpretation of the form describe by Stephens under the name of plasmodium tenue be not a new species of parasite or a ameboid form , but a parasite attach to the external surface of red corpuscle and distort by technique . 2 . evidence against a new species of parasite be : -lrb- a -rrb- they may be find in all know malarial infection and at any stage in the development of parasite or a ameboid form ; and -lrb- b -rrb- they show evidence of distortion . 3 . evidence against ameboid form and in favor of distorted parasite be : -lrb- a -rrb- they may be find in but one of the two cover-slip prepared simultaneously ; -lrb- b -rrb- they may be find in certain definite group in various part of a film which otherwise contain normal appear parasite ; -lrb- c -rrb- in rich infection , contain many disforted form , they may be find in certain part of a film , all distort in one direction , the infected corpuscle and those adjacent to they show no evidence of injury ; and -lrb- d -rrb- two or more parasite attach to one red corpuscle may be see to be distort in one direction , or to have nucleus similarly distort . 4 . three general type of distorted parasite may be recognize : -lrb- a -rrb- parasite with nucleus similarly distort and cytoplasm unaltered or but slightly distorted ; -lrb- b -rrb- parasite with cytoplasm distorted and nucleus similarly distort intact or but little disturbed ; and -lrb- b -rrb- parasite with cytoplasm distorted and nucleus similarly distort intact or but little disturbed . 5 . Red corpuscle to which distort parasite be attach usually appear to be flatten out with slightly irregular outline , but parasite be attach usually may be more or less distorted without any apparent change in the infected corpuscle . 6 . parasite with well stain chromatin and fade cytoplasm , or parasite be attach usually with well stain cytoplasm and fade chromatin , may be find in these specimen . it be usually possible to restain these specimen bring out the fade cytoplasm belong to the well stain chromatin or the lose chromatin belong to the well stain cytoplasm . 
culture of streptococcus viridan when bring into contact with red blood corpuscle have the power of transform oxyhemoglobin into methemoglobin . a simple molecular one occur only in the presence of live streptococcus when streptococcus viridan when bring into contact with red blood corpuscle be able to carry on streptococcus viridan when bring into contact with red blood corpuscle metabolic activity . the intensity of a simple molecular one run roughly parallel with the period of growth and multiplication of the bacterium themselves and gradually diminish and disappear as growth cease . there be no apparent relation between the activity of a give strain of streptococcus viridan in produce methemoglobin and produce methemoglobin source or virulence . if live streptococcus be suspend in salt solution streptococcus viridan in produce methemoglobin and its source or virulence be unable to change oxyhemoglobin into methemoglobin unless some nutrient substance be present . of the various nutrient substance test dextrose be the most efficient in enable the organism to bring about a simple molecular one . a simple molecular one do not occur in the absence of oxygen , and be retard by a excess of oxygen . substance which tend to reduce the metabolic activity of the bacterium themselves to a minimum exert a inhibitory action on methemoglobin formation . while not definitely prove a minimum to be so , the result obtain in the above experiment strongly support the supposition that a simple molecular one be not due to injurious substance produce by the bacterium themselves or to product arise from the decomposition of the nutrient material present , but rather to the metabolic activity of the bacterium themselves when themselves be surround by environmental condition which render growth and multiplication of the bacterium possible . the exact chemical nature of the change of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin be not know , but the exact chemical nature of the change of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin be probably the exact chemical nature of the change of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin or a combination of reduction and oxidation process , as point out by Heubner . as Cole have show , the action of aminophenol be of great interest in this connection , in that the action of aminophenol act like a catalytic agent in be able to transform much more hemoglobin into methemoglobin than would be possible if a simple molecular one be a simple molecular one . the metabolic activity of the bacterium themselves be largely in the nature of reduction and oxidation process . the transformation of oxyhemoglobin into methemoglobin by streptococcus of the viridan type , therefore , may be analogous to the action of such substance as aminophenol , and a simple molecular one may be due to the active oxidation and reduction process occur in the neighborhood of the bacterial cell . the failure of the reaction to occur in the absence of oxygen and the absence of oxygen retardation in the presence of a excess of oxygen , both with streptococcus of the viridan type , therefore and with pneumococcus -lrb- Cole -rrb- would seem to support this theory . such result , however , may be due to the abnormal condition surround the bacterium themselves with consequent inhibition of streptococcus viridan when bring into contact with red blood corpuscle metabolic activity . Cole conclude as the result of Cole study of methemoglobin formation by pneumococcus that since the bacterium themselves may injure red blood cell apparently by the disturbance in oxidation rather than by the production of a definite toxin , it be possible that the bacterium themselves may injure other tissue cell in a like manner and that the pathological effect produce by the bacterium themselves may be explain on this basis . the experimental result record above have show that the formation of methemoglobin by streptococcus viridan in no way differ from the formation of methemoglobin by streptococcus viridan in no way the formation of methemoglobin by streptococcus viridan in no way by pneumococcus that since the bacterium themselves may injure red blood cell apparently by          the disturbance in oxidation rather than by the production of a definite toxin , it be possible that the bacterium themselves may injure other tissue cell in a like manner and that the pathological effect produce by  the bacterium themselves may be explain on this basis , and streptococcus viridan in no way lend support to the theory that the bacterium themselves may be injurious to tissue because of the disturbance in oxidation bring about by the metabolic activity of the organism , especially those associate with growth and multiplication of the bacterium . it be believe that this theory may be particularly applicable to the pathological effect cause by streptococcus vindan because the lesion produce by this theory this theory , both in man and in experimental animal , be prone to be localized and associate with the actual presence of the streptococcus in the lesion . 
acute gastric ulcer be find in a large percentage of animal die from acute adrenal insufficiency . in dog in which a portion of the jejunum have be transplant some time previous to the removal of the adrenal , the gastric mucosa show more marked change than the transplant jejunal mucosa . this tend to show that a secondary although necessary factor be but a secondary although necessary factor . 
the result observe with this strain of treponema pallidum may be state as follow : 1 . normal human serum do not agglutinate this culture of treponema pallidum in dilution of 1:5 or higher ; equal part of this culture of  treponema pallidum and normal serum -lrb- this dilution -rrb- result in agglutination in about 50 per cent of the serum . with the strain of treponema pallidum use in this study specific agglutination be not consider as have occur unless observe in dilution of 1:5 , or better 1:10 and higher or higher . 2 . the agglutinating power of the serum of non-syphilitic person suffer with various infection be not higher than that of normal serum . 3 . trace of specific agglutinin for this culture of treponema pallidum be find in the serum of non-syphilitic person suffer with various infection in the primary stage of syphilis . 4 . in the secondary stage of syphilis about 58 per cent of serum show the presence of a demonstrable amount of agglutinin in dilution of 1:5 , or better 1:10 and higher and higher ; in no instance , however , be agglutination in evidence in dilution of 1:5 , or better 1:10 and higher higher than 1:20 . 5 . in tertiary and latent syphilis , mostly infection of the central nervous system , agglutination in   dilution of 1:5 , or better 1:10 and higher and higher ; in no instance be find with about 84 per serum show the presence of a demonstrable amount of agglutinin in   dilution of 1:5 , or better 1:10 and higher and higher ; in no instance . the highest concentration of pallida agglutinin in the blood serum be find in the later stage of syphilis . 6 . the formation of agglutinin for culture treponema pallidum in human syphilis be probably tardy and do not reach a state of high concentration . 7 . there be no direct relation between the presence of the Wassermann antibody and agglutinin for this strain in the serum of syphilitic . the former appear in the body fluid earlier and be probably in higher concentration in all stage of syphilis ; while agglutination be most likely to occur with Wassermann positive serum , it may be occasionally observe with serum show the presence of a demonstrable amount of agglutinin in   dilution of 1:5 , or better 1:10 and higher and higher ; in no instance yield negative Wassermann reaction . likewise strongly Wassermann positive serum may not contain demonstrable amount of agglutinin . 8 . it be probable that different strain of pallida vary in susceptibility to agglutination . for example , in the first investigation on agglutinin for treponema pallidum by Kolmer , the serum of syphilitic in different stage of the disease do not cause agglutination of one of Noguchi 's strain in dilution of 1:20 and higher , whereas the strain use in the present study be frequently agglutinate in this dilution by serum from a similar group of patient . as show by Zinsser , Hopkins , and McBurney , virulent pallida from human lesion resist agglutination to a remarkable degree . 9 . while further study be necessary to establish the practical value of agglutination in the diagnosis of human syphilis , we believe that with a suitable culture or culture well marked agglutination of treponema pallidum in dilution of 1:5 , or better 1:10 and higher , or   dilution of 1:5 , or better 1:10 and higher , or better 1:10 and higher and higher , indicate pallida infection and may prove of value in the diagnosis of isolate case , particularly in the later stage of syphilis . investigation bear upon the relation of agglutinin for culture pallida to immunity in syphilis will be give in a separate communication -lrb- 16 -rrb- . 
it seem evident from the foregoing experiment that the so call tumor -lrb- adenoma -rrb- of the thyroid possess the property of take up iodine and metabolize the thyroid into the active combination in the same way that the non-tumorous thyroid tissue do , although not so readily nor to the same degree , and the action on tadpole of feed desiccate tumorous thyroid tissue do not differ qualitatively from feed desiccate non-tumorous thyroid tissue . the action on tadpole of feed desiccate tumorous thyroid tissue in either case depend upon the iodine -lrb- active iodine -rrb- content , and in the case of the adenomata bear no constant relation to the state of they growth or differentiation . examination of Tables Table II and III show that in the main this be true . there be , however , certain discrepancy as to time of death , appearance of first foreleg , degree of emaciation , and rate of growth in certain dish of the series , the action be not quite parallel to the iodine -lrb- active iodine -rrb- content . some of certain discrepancy may be explain in part by accident of feeding , slight difference in size , age -rrb- and susceptibility of Tadpoles , and also by the variation in the amount of thyroid consume by the different individual in the same dish . Lenhart have show that the action of   Tadpoles vary with the quantity fed . another important factor which have to be consider be another important factor which have to be consider . it be suspect at the time of the foregoing experiment that the iodine itself might be present in a active and a inactive form , but no satisfactory proof of this assumption , at the beginning of the foregoing experiment , be at hand . support of this point have be afford by the work of Kendall on the isolation of the active thyroid principle and the separation of the iodine itself into two fraction . since the completion of the foregoing experiment Marine have demonstrate by means of perfusion experiment in vivo and in vitro that iodine be rapidly take up by the thyroid cell , and though 1,000 per cent in 2 hour may be 1,000 per cent in 2 hour as compare with the control lobe , yet the action on Tadpoles be no greater . it then become a important question to determine the time require by the thyroid to take up inorganic iodine and manufacture the thyroid into the active thyroid principle . it be know that iodine be rapidly take up by the thyroid , and in man the iodine content of the thyroid be subject to greater variation than in animal on account of the prevalent therapeutic use of iodine and the iodide in goiter and other condition ; even the iodine use in prepare patient for operation would increase the iodine content of  the thyroid in a short time , so that one might expect such variation in the action of a give thyroid preparation feed to Tadpoles as appear in the foregoing experiment . in this connection it be interesting to note -lrb- Table II -rrb- this connection thyroid 20 with 4.31 mg . of iodine be only slightly more active than no. 5 with 1.31 mg . of iodine . two possibility have to be consider here . first , no. 20 may have active iodine slightly greater than 1.31 mg . and the balance present as inactive iodine . second , no. 5 with 1.31 mg with 1.31 1.31 mg . of iodine might represent the maximum possible effect under the condition of the experiment and a larger quantity of active thyroid iodine could produce no greater effect . of course with the lower iodine contents the variation in effect might well come within the limit of error of observation . also the percentage error would be greater in the iodine determination , the iodine determination of feeding , etc. . we conclusion as to the effect of feed desiccate thyroid to Tadpoles agree in general with those of Lenhart . the action of a give thyroid preparation feed to Tadpoles depend not upon a specific stimulus to differentiation but upon a stimulation of metabolism in general in proportion to the active iodine and the quantity consume . high iodine contents produce rapid emaciation , at the same time result in differentiation even in tadpole die in 8 to 12 day . low iodine contents result in differentiation at a earlier period than the control . Tadpoles feed on thyrous 
the picture be one of a true diabetes mellitus , first attract attention after miscarriage . although the g : n ratio sink from 3 : 1 on 10 gm . of nitrogen to 1.7 : 1 after 3 day ' fasting , the disease progress steadily in spite of a long continued carbohydrate-free diet . together with the usual complication of diabetes , a malignant tumor of the thymus develop , so that after 5 month ' observation a slow death be forestall by chloroform . the large , apparently normal pancreas , which exhibit histologically marked change in the island of langerhan , extreme hydropic degeneration and exhaustion of granule , involve both alpha and beta cell , but especially the latter , and replacement of some island by fibrous tissue be the large , apparently normal pancreas , which exhibit histologically marked change in the island of langerhan , extreme hydropic degeneration and exhaustion of granule , involve both alpha and beta cell , but especially the latter , and replacement of some island by fibrous tissue , which exhibit histologically marked change in the island of langerhan , extreme hydropic degeneration and exhaustion of granule , involve both alpha and beta cell , but alpha and beta cell , and replacement of some island by fibrous tissue . 
1 . unmodified human plasma be not a satisfactory culture medium for human tissue owe to the susceptibility of human fibrin to digestion by tissue ferment . the necessary framework be thus destroy before the cell begin to migrate . the difficulty can be overcome by add to human plasma or serum a small quantity of fowl or pigeon plasma , the fibrin of which be highly resistant to digestion . human tissue owe to the susceptibility of human fibrin to digestion by tissue ferment have be propagate in this medium for several month through subculture , and growth in vitro can probably be maintain indefinitely . 2 . human tissue owe to the susceptibility of human fibrin to digestion by tissue ferment show no greater sensitiveness to change in temperature and mechanical injury associate with preparation of culture than those of lower animal . those of lower animal may be preserve in a ordinary ice box at 10-15 degree c. as long as 6 or 8 day . tissue obtain at operation give best result , but piece of organ remove at autopsy 1 to 4 hour after death sometimes show active growth . 3 . the presence of normally exist iso-antibody -lrb- agglutinin and hemolysin -rrb- in human serum be without influence on the growth of human tissue owe to the susceptibility of human fibrin to digestion by tissue ferment in vitro . in other word , autogenous serum have no advantage in tissue culture over homologous serum . 
1 . the addition of salvarsan in vitro produce a spirocheticidal mixture which be increase in potency by heating . 2 . the heated serum of salvarsan-treated patient be more spirocheticidal if the heated serum of salvarsan-treated patient have be in contact with the clot over night than if the heated serum of salvarsan-treated patient have be separate immediately after coagulation . this be not true with the serum from blood which have be salvarsanize in vitro . 3 . the addition of salvarsan directly to serum produce a more potent mixture than result from the serum from blood which have be salvarsanize in vitro from blood to which salvarsan have be add in equivalent amount . 4 . the increase in activity of salvarsanized serum produce by heat to 56 degree c. be due in part to the removal of inhibitory substance in the serum from blood which have be salvarsanize in vitro and in part to a direct increase in spirocheticidal power in the heated salvarsan . 5 . both salvarsanized and neosalvarsanized serum be render more spirocheticidal by heating . 6 . a more active spirocheticidal mixture be produce by mix small amount of salvarsan with the serum of a salvarsan-treated patient than by mix the same amount with normal serum . 
1 . culture of diplococcus pneumoniae , bacillus coli , bacillus fluorescen liquefacien and bacillus prodigiosus , when grow in meat infusion broth exhibit a initial latent period when the culture use for inoculation be no longer grow at the culture use for inoculation maximum rate ; if , however , the culture use for inoculation be grow at the culture use for inoculation most rapid rate the bacterium , upon subculture , show a initial latent period but continue to multiply at the same rate as that of the parent culture . 2 . if broth culture of pneumococcus be centrifuge at the beginning of the period of maximum rate of growth , the bacterium remain in the supernatant fluid continue to grow at a rapid rate upon further incubation ; if , however , the culture use for inoculation be centrifuge at the end of maximum rate of growth , those bacterium which remain in the supernatant fluid show a prolonged latent period , during which many of the organism die . while the death of the bacterium remain in the supernatant fluid be take place the process follow closely the law of unimolecular reaction . 3 . actively grow pneumococcus inoculate into the supernatant fluid from a 4 day culture of the same strain continue to grow rapidly for a appreciable time after inoculation . 4 . the filtrate inhibit the further growth of actively grow pneumococcus inoculate into the supernatant fluid from a 4 day culture of the same strain when the latter be inoculate into such filtrate . this inhibitory action of the filtrate be lose in part as the culture from which the filtrate be obtain be allow to incubate longer . 5 . actively grow pneumococcus inoculate into the supernatant fluid from a 4 day culture of the same strain , after exposure at low temperature to the action of the filtrate of a 24 hour broth culture of the same strain , show a greater lag than the control . 6 . the foregoing fact offer strong support for the view that lag be a expression of injury which the bacterial cell have sustain from the bacterial cell previous environment . 
it be possible to reduce the resistance of guinea pig to tuberculosis by x-ray exposure , so that when animal inoculation be require for a diagnosis a much quicker result may be have than by the use of normal animal . in renal tuberculosis when it be necessary to resort to normal animal , the use of normal animal ordinarily require from 5 to 7 week , while by the use of x-rayed guinea pig a diagnosis can be make in from 8 to 10 day . the resistance of guinea pig can be sufficiently lower by one massive dose of x-ray administer either shortly before or after the inoculation of the material to be test . the lesion be so marked in normal animal that a diagnosis be certain after the interval indicate above . 
1 . a method for measure the area of a wound not geometric in form be describe . 2 . the rate of cicatrization of a wound be greater at the beginning than at the end of the period of repair . the rate of cicatrization of a wound depend on the area of a wound not geometric rather than on the age of a wound . there be a constant relation between the size of a wound and the rate of cicatrization of a wound . the larger the wound the greater be the rate of cicatrization of a wound . two wound of different size have a tendency to become equal . 3 . the rate of cicatrization of a wound be proportional to the area of a wound not geometric , but diminish less rapidly than the area of a wound not geometric . 4 . the more important factor in the repair of  a wound be the more important factor in the repair of a wound . epidermization complete the work of contraction . after a wound be heal , the cicatrix as a rule expand . 5 . the curve represent the diminution of the size of a aseptic wound while the diminution of the size of a aseptic wound cicatrize be regular and geometric . 
the cicatrization of sterile wound may be study in the same way as a ordinary physicochemical phenomenon . it be possible , therefore , to express the law of cicatrization by a mathematical equation as soon as a accurate measure of the wound can be obtain . by means of a mathematical equation , a curve be obtain which represent the theoretical evolution of the cicatrization of a wound . a daily point of comparison to what appear actually on the observe wound , and allow one to study accurately the fluctuation of cicatrization on a give individual , and the action of different dressing and antiseptic substance , be a expression of what should happen on a normal wound , healing aseptically , on a normal man , be a daily point of comparison to what appear actually on the observe wound , and allow one to study accurately the fluctuation of cicatrization on a give individual , and the action of different dressing and antiseptic substance . 
the first article of this series show that it be possible to express mathematically the phenomenon of cicatrization . the principal point consist in determine by means of a equation , a constant , or index , characterize each wound . the calculation have to be make for each patient for each wound , and require two observation , 4 day apart . this index i have prove to be a continuous function of the size of each wound and of the age of each patient for each wound , of the form see pdf for equation where s be the area , i this index i , a a decimal exponent , and K a constant , it be then possible to draw a chart by means of which this index i could be obtain without calculation . the advantage of the new way of determine this index i be , above all , that a general , average , normal index be a general , average , normal index , and no longer a individual index . hence , the difference between the observe rate of cicatrization of man and the normal rate may give some indication of the general state of each patient for each wound . another advantage be that the determination of this index i be no longer control by the temporary accident which may happen between the two observation of s and s ' . 
we have already describe briefly the portal of entry and of excretion of the pathogenic spirochete . we may mention here that we have twice prevent epidemic by disinfection of the ground and the removal of the inundate water in certain place in coal mine . in one mine 19 out of 50 workman , and in another 9 out of 30 workman come down with  Weil 's disease , one in 1 week , the other 8 to 9 day in about 2 week . we have already point out that the period during which the pathogenic spirochete be excrete in the urine continue , as a rule , for 40 day , in one case until the 42nd day , in one case until the 45th day , and in still another case , and that we must , therefore , apply disinfection for at least 40 day after the first appearance of  Weil 's disease , one in 1 week , the other 8 to 9 day . lately we have find that in 21 case out of 24 the pathogenic spirochete be excrete in the urine for 40 day , in one case until the 42nd day , in one case until the 45th day , and in still another case , in one case until the 45th day , and in still another case until the 63rd day . another important fact concern the prophylaxis which have be bring out be that both house and ditch rat -lrb- brown -rrb- carry virulent spirochaeta icterohamorrhaga , the causal spirochete of  Weil 's disease , one in 1 week , the other 8 to 9 day , in virulent spirochaeta icterohamorrhaga kidney . Miyajima 's have report that field rat have the pathogenic organism in virulent spirochaeta icterohamorrhaga kidney ; Weil 's will report these finding in detail later . the spirochete which Weil 's describe be less virulent than we . on Weil 's advice we have carefully examine house and ditch rat in the city and field rat in the coal mine of Kyushu , where  Weil 's disease , one in 1 week , the other 8 to 9 day prevail , and find that 39.5 per cent carry highly virulent pathogenic spirochete in virulent spirochaeta icterohamorrhaga kidney , thus confirm Miyajima 's experiment . virulent spirochaeta icterohamorrhaga kidney be examine microscopically under the dark-field microscope , and in the case in which we do not find the pathogenic spirochete , we make inoculation into guinea pig . thus we find spirochaeta icterohaemorrhagia microscopically in virulent spirochaeta icterohamorrhaga kidney or in the urine in 32.4 per cent , and by means of inoculation in 7 per cent , make a total of 39.5 per cent carry the pathogenic organism in they kidney , out of a total number of 86 rat examine . in some instance , field rat be make to bite guinea pig and in two instance cause  Weil 's disease , one in 1 week , the other 8 to 9 day . among fifty-five patient in we clinic , twelve be cook ; and in Europe many case arise among butchers-indicate the relation of  Weil 's disease , one in 1 week , the other 8 to 9 day to field rat . moreover , during the present year we observe two patient who acquire  Weil 's disease , one in 1 week , the other 8 to 9 day , one in 1 week , the other 8 to 9 day after fifty-five patient in we clinic have be bite by field rat . these fact point to a relation between Weil 's disease and rat . the infection be transmit probably from the rat by means of the urine of the rat , directly or indirectly . on the injection of 0.1 gm . of rat urine which contain spirochaeta icterohaemorrhagia into the peritoneal cavity of guinea pig , the infection arise , while the injection of the liver or the blood of the rat into guinea pig do not produce the typical disease . the finding that the kidney of field rat contain the pathogenic organism of    Weil 's disease , one in 1 week , the other 8 to 9 day , one in 1 week , the other 8 to 9 day be important from the point of view of prophylaxis . the large number of rat in the trench of the european battle-field suggest the possibility that many case of    Weil 's disease , one in 1 week , the other 8 to 9 day , one in 1 week , the other 8 to 9 day may arise . we shall report on this point in more detail later . 
horse immunize with culture of spirochaeta icterohaemorrhagia yield a immune serum have therapeutic property . with rare exception a immune serum have therapeutic property destroy completely the spirochete contain in the circulate blood . the development of antibody be promote by the serum injection . the number of spirochete in the organ be reduce by the treatment . secondary manifestation due to a immune serum have therapeutic property be slight and disappear promptly . the ultimate effect of the serum treatment on the symptom and final outcome of the disease have still to be determine . 
1 . the theory of the production of gall-bladder lesion in typhoid , by descend infection of the bile from the liver receive support from investigation with the common duct fistula method in the rabbit . more bacillus appear in the bile with increase dose and more gall-bladder infection be obtain by increase dose . more bacillus appear in the bile after mesenteric vein injection than after ear vein injection and more lesion result under the first condition . more bacillus appear in the bile after injection of the same dose in immunized animal than in normal animal and more lesion also result in immunized animal . in cholera and dysentery the same mechanism be suggest with the additional factor of a portal system septicemia . 2 . after the appearance of microorganism in rabbit bile , they fate be apparently largely determine by the antiseptic property of rabbit bile . 100 per cent infection can not be secure by intravenous dose large enough to insure the presence of rabbit bile . rabbit bile in vitro may be antiseptic to the microorganism consider . the antiseptic action be largely due to the antiseptic action alkalinity . it be apparently possible to protect the rabbit to some degree against gall-bladder infection by a previous injection of sodium bicarbonate . 3 . alkaline therapy be suggest in the prevention and cure of gall-bladder carrier . 
the progress of a infection be usually associate with marked change in the serum protein . there may be a increase in the percentage of the total protein during some stage of a infection , and there be usually a change in the albumin-globulin ratio with a increase in the total globulin . this rise may antedate the development of any resistance by a considerable period of time . the non-protein constituent of the blood show fluctuation with a tendency to rise as a infection progress . the process of immunization be in almost all instance associate with a definite increase in the globulin of the blood , and in some case with a complete inversion of the normal albumin-globulin ratio . this may be produce both by live and dead organism and by bacterial endotoxin . massive dose usually result in a upset which show no tendency to right this during the period of observation . a rise in the globulin of  the blood have be show to occur long before the animal develop immune body in any appreciable concentration ; and where the globulin curve and antibody curve appear to parallel one another , it can be show by a careful analysis of both curve that there be a definite lack of correspondence at various period of the experiment . animal possess a basic immunity show a more rapid rise in the globulin curve follow inoculation . there be no parallelism between the leukocytic reaction and the globulin reaction . during period of leukopenia the globulin of  the blood may be as high as during the period of a leukocytosis . bacterial endotoxin produce as strike a increase in the serum globulin as do live and kill bacterium . this would seem to indicate that a bacterial invasion of the organism be not absolutely essential for the globulin change , and that the toxogenic factor in infection and immunity must play a part in the production of the change note . inflammatory irritant inject intraperitoneally also result in a globulin increase . in this case the globulin change produce may best be explain by the toxogenic effect produce by the protein split product result from the inflammatory condition . intraperitoneal injection of kill bacterium give rise to a more rapid increase in the serum the serum globulin . the rapidity of the response follow intraperitoneal as compare with intravenous injection doubtless stand in intimate relationship to the neutralize power possess by the blood serum and perhaps to the more extensive surface of absorption follow injection by the intraperitoneal route . 
the follow conclusion may be draw from the experiment present in this article . 1 . excessive meat diet develop no hypertrophy of the thyroid gland . a definite hypertrophy of the parathyroid gland under the same condition have not be establish . a meat diet do not develop   no hypertrophy of the thyroid gland when insufficiency of the parathyroid gland under the same condition exist at the same time , even if no clinical symptom be present . where a pronounced hypertrophy cause by a meat diet have already develop , a pronounced hypertrophy cause by   a meat diet disappear and   no hypertrophy of the thyroid gland assume   no hypertrophy of the thyroid gland ordinary appearance after extirpation of a sufficiently large number of parathyroid gland . 2 . after parathyroidectomy no hypertrophy of   no hypertrophy of the thyroid gland take place . in chronic tetany   no hypertrophy of the thyroid gland seem , on the contrary , to atrophy in spite of a meat diet . 3 . after complete extirpation of   no hypertrophy of the thyroid gland , the parathyroid gland under the same condition do not change   no hypertrophy of the thyroid gland structure , even in case where the cachexium last for several year . small remain part of the thyroid gland may through hypertrophy develop into compact tissue and thereby seemingly present some point of resemblance to the parathyroid gland under the same condition . 4 . when the parathyroid gland hypertrophy , as in some form of chronic tetany , no hypertrophy of the thyroid gland be characterize by the development of large , transparent , sharply define cell , with large nucleus rich in chromatin . 5 . the parathyroid and thyroid gland be the parathyroid and thyroid gland the parathyroid and thyroid gland . this , however , do not exclude the occurrence of a direct or indirect interaction in the function of the two system . 6 . there be reason to believe that a insufficiency of the parathyroid gland check to some extent the function of   no hypertrophy of the thyroid gland . no proof of the existence of a vicarious cooperation between the two gland have be establish . 
1 . immune serum produce in rabbit by treatment with we culture strain a of treponema pallidum agglutinate not only the homologous strain , but also the Noguchi strain , and indicate a close group relationship of other non-pathogenic treponema . absorption experiment confirm this , indicate a close relationship between treponema pallidum and the calligyrum . 2 . culture treponema be not agglutinate to a much greater extent by the serum of syphilitic rabbit than culture treponema be by those of normal rabbit . 3 . culture treponema be not agglutinate to any considerable extent by the serum of rabbit immunize with virulent treponema . 4 . the serum of syphilitic patient , especially syphilitic patient pallidum to a slightly greater extent than do those of normal individual , but pallidum to a slightly greater extent be agglutinate to a almost equal degree by the serum of many individual with disease other than syphilis . we do not think that we could definitely distinguish the syphilitic from the non-syphilitic serum by the agglutination of      syphilitic patient pallida , and therefore we do not believe that the reaction have any diagnostic value at present . 5 . immunization with culture pallidum to a slightly greater extent , either general or local , do not seem to confer upon rabbit any considerable degree of resistance to inoculation with virulent treponema . 6 . rabbit that have once exhibit lesion in the testis be not easily reinfect at the same site if reinoculation be practice more than a month or so after apparent healing of the lesion . we believe that the experiment above record strongly suggest that a localized cell phenomenon not dependent be a localized cell phenomenon not dependent upon a generalize reaction on the part of tissue remote from the site directly involve in reaction with the invade treponema . antibody analogous to those form in most bacterial infection appear in the general circulation in slight amount , if at all . the finding of many motionless treponema in a few of the small lesion follow reinoculation suggest the possibility of a purely localized formation of antibody analogous to those form in most bacterial infection . this be express by Landsteiner some year ago when Landsteiner speak of the localized formation of agglutinin when agglutinin be absent in the general circulation in slight amount . we hesitate to apply these result too generally to the condition prevail in human syphilis , but this contain the possibility of a explanation for the apparent skin immunity of the secondary period , and the later successive involvement of some organ and tissue when other remain normal and when external superinfection be successfully resist . 
1 . the reaction of the respiratory mechanism to carbon dioxide be greatly diminish in pneumonia . 2 . the graver the less  the reaction of the respiratory mechanism to carbon dioxide , the less the reaction of the respiratory mechanism to carbon dioxide . 
the experiment that have be report indicate that stimulation of either the right vagus or the left vagus nerve be equally effectual in block impulse from the auricle when to the ventricle when auricular fibrillation be present . the left vagus nerve be as effectual in block impulse from the normally beat the auricle when as from the auricle when in a state of fibrillation , and the type of auricular activity have apparently no influence on the effect which either the right vagus or the left vagus nerve have on auriculoventricular conduction . 
the experiment indicate that the perfused pancreas , do not alter the reduce property of the perfused solution .   , however , seem to supply something to the Locke 's solution circulate through   artery which in some way bring about a utilization of sugar by the living heart to a extent that do not occur with the living heart alone . this pancreatic substance possess some of the characteristic of a enzyme . this pancreatic substance be inactivate by boil ; it be unstable , rapidly become inactive on standing ; this pancreatic substance act in small amount ; this pancreatic substance cause a great acceleration in the rate of a reaction which otherwise proceed slowly , and the rate of a reaction which otherwise proceed slowly diminish as the reaction proceeds . thus this pancreatic substance have more of a enzyme than of a stable internal secretion like that of the adrenal gland . the disappearance of sugar be dependent upon the presence of live heart tissue , and the disappearance of sugar cease as soon as the perfusate be remove from the heart-pancreas circulation and do not occur at all when a pancreatic perfusate be pass through a non-beating heart . this result indicate that a reaction which otherwise proceed slowly be not similar to that obtain when muscle and pancreas extract act on more concentrated solution of dextrose . the living heart in the presence of the pancreatic factor and dextrose , be responsible for two effect . first , a condensation of the sugar to a non-reducing form that yield again a simple sugar on hydrolysis or by simply stand , with a preservative , at 37 degree a preservative . second , a disappearance of the sugar to a non-reducing form that be probably due to second destruction by hydrolysis or oxidation . after deduct the reduce sugar in the heart-pancreas perfusion which could be recover by hydrolysis , the amount of sugar which have actually disappear exceed that the amount of sugar which have actually disappear be use by the living heart when perfuse with dextrose alone . as to the fate of this portion of the reduce sugar in the heart-pancreas perfusion which could be recover by hydrolysis , no definite evidence be obtain . the question arise as to whether this substance obtain from the perfused pancreas be identical with the hypothetical internal secretion of the pancreas so essential in sugar metabolism . the question there be a internal secretion of the pancreas which can be obtain by this method , and that in some way some way accelerate a utilization of sugar by the living heart , seem evident . though the conclusion be base on the heart and pancreas isolate from the numerous interrelating factor occur in the body , no definite evidence suggest , at least , that the substance or substance obtain by perfuse   may be concern in the normal activity of   upon sugar metabolism . 
1 . pneumococcus of type i and type ii be responsible for the majority of the case of lobar pneumonia . 2 . among the pneumococcus find in the mouth of healthy individual , type iv predominate , type iii be fairly frequent , and atypical organism of type ii be occasionally encounter . organism of these type give rise to a minority of the case of lobar pneumonia . 3 . healthy person intimately associate with the case of lobar pneumonia may harbor in healthy person intimately associate with    the case of lobar pneumonia mouth secretion the highly parasitic pneumococcus of type i and ii . 4 . occasionally a carrier of type i or type ii pneumococcus be encounter in whom it be impossible to trace any contact with a infected patient . 5 . convalescent from lobar pneumonia may carry for a considerable period of time the type of pneumococcus with which convalescent from lobar pneumonia be infect . 
it may be say that at rest all the factor of respiration , gaseous exchange , carbon dioxide tension , and the mechanical factor , be normal in person with a collapsed lung , that the reaction to carbon dioxide be normal up to the point at which the respiration be treble , or sometimes quadruple , but that beyond the point at which the respiration be treble a limit may be reach . the ventilation of the lung can be accomplish in a entirely normal manner in spite of a greatly reduce vital capacity . the only difference between a collapsed lung be that the latter when call upon to increase the ventilation of the lung reach a limit a little sooner than the former . from these finding we might deduce that there will be no dyspnea except after moderate exertion . and this deduction be bear out by the history of the patient . in other word , in the lung , as in other organ , there be a large factor of safety , one lung be as efficient as two , except when the work do call for more than a threefold increase in the normal ventilation . 
the comparative resistance of bacterium -lrb- staphylococcus aureus -rrb- and human tissue cell to antiseptic and other chemical may be easily test by tissue culture under condition which approximate those find in the living body . a comparative study show that while human cell -lrb- connective tissue and wander human tissue cell to antiseptic and other chemical -rrb- be highly resistant to many antiseptic , those find in the living body be in general more easily kill than bacterium -lrb- staphylococcus aureus -rrb- . of the antiseptic test , which include mercuric chloride , iodine , potassium mercuric iodide , phenol , tricresol , hydrogen peroxide , hypochlorite -lrb- Dakin 's solution -rrb- , argyrol , and alcohol , the one which approach most closely the ideal disinfectant be the one which approach most closely the ideal disinfectant . 
1 . Retina pigment epithelium cell and iris pigment cell be place in a identical medium . 2 . the differentiation into the pigment strain of the migrate pigment  Retina pigment epithelium cell and iris pigment cell , as well as the pigment strain of the migrate pigment Retina pigment epithelium cell and iris pigment cell , be lose . the normally highly specialize cuticular structure disappear . Retina pigment epithelium cell and iris pigment cell begin to move and assume a spindle shape , thus lose the normally original hexagonal shape . 3 . the migrate iris Retina pigment epithelium cell and iris pigment cell begin to show a distribution of the migrate pigment  Retina pigment epithelium cell and iris pigment cell , similar to Retina pigment epithelium cell and iris pigment cell exhibit by the migrate pigment  Retina pigment epithelium cell and iris pigment cell . the cuticular structure of this cell type also disappear . Retina pigment epithelium cell and iris pigment cell also assume the ability of free movement and become spindle-shaped . 4 . by means of these change both cell type not only become more similar to the ordinary culture cell type , but also in certain respects , more like each other , whereas before explantation they be very unlike . in order to accomplish this Retina pigment epithelium cell and iris pigment cell must change much more thoroughly than Retina pigment epithelium cell and iris pigment cell . 5 . these change , particularly these change , show a definite relation to the change of external factor , as this be the expression of the transmission from dissimilar condition exist on different side of Retina pigment epithelium cell and iris pigment cell into condition which be uniform on all side . 
the fact that the coagulative principle be closely associate with the euglobulin fraction of the blood be of clinical as well as of theoretical interest . the fact that the coagulative principle be closely associate with the euglobulin fraction of the blood enable we to prepare a hemostatic contain about 2 per cent of protein which be more potent than the whole serum contain 6 to 7 per cent of protein . a preparation of this kind have be make in this laboratory from horse serum and employ during the past few month in numerous case of bleeding . this euglobulin be absolutely sterile , as this euglobulin have be pass through a Berkefeld filter , and be safeguard against decomposition by the addition of 0.3 per cent tricresol . a detailed account of the therapeutic use of euglobulin will be report elsewhere . it may be state , however , that a detailed account of the therapeutic use of euglobulin have be employ in the various manifestation of intractable hemorrhage in which horse serum have be so largely resort to of late year , and that in certain case have seem to bring about most satisfactory result ; in no instance have there be any untoward effect . when intravenous injection be resort to , euglobulin seem to be preferable to serum which contain fully three time the quantity of protein . it also seem to be absorb more quickly from the subcutaneous tissue . in all probability it will be find to meet the same indication as whole serum , possess the advantage of concentration , and necessitate the introduction into the body of a much smaller amount of foreign protein . 
1 . no evidence have be obtain that in cat and dog with the nerve of one adrenal cut , emotional disturbance cause depletion of the epinephrin store of the normally innervate adrenal as compare with depletion of the epinephrin store of the fellow . 2 . the depletion of the epinephrin store in cat under morphine be not dependent upon so call morphine fright , since a similar depletion be find in dog in which , as be know , morphine produce symptom the reverse of those of fright . 3 . the sign of morphine fright can all be elicit by administer morphine to a cat in which one adrenal have be remove and the nerve supply of the other cut , and in which accordingly no detectable liberation of epinephrin take place . 4 . the reaction of the denervate iris elicit by emotional disturbance , asphyxia , or etherization in a cat in which one adrenal have be remove , one of whose adrenal have be remove and the nerve of one adrenal cut of the other cut , do not differ from these reaction in cat whose adrenal have not be interfere with . 5 . the influence of postoperative edema of the adrenal in diminish the epinephrin load , and the influence of postoperative edema of the adrenal in diminish the epinephrin load , have be study in rabbit . 6 . the diminution in the epinephrin store of the adrenal which follow operation on animal -lrb- postoperative depletion -rrb- have be study . it be only in part associate with the anesthesia , since the anesthesia may be as marked 6 or 8 hour after a operation last less than 1 hour as after marked 6 or 8 hour anesthesia without operation . 7 . one adrenal be remove in rabbit and the epinephrin content of the remain gland assay at vary period of  the influence of postoperative edema of the adrenal in diminish the epinephrin load after removal of the first , the period be longer than  the influence of postoperative edema of the adrenal in diminish the epinephrin load necessary for recovery from the postoperative depletion . in general , the second adrenal contain more epinephrin than the first , sometimes double the amount . 8 . marked depletion of the epinephrin store of innervated adrenal as compare with the corresponding denervated gland be see in animal dead of infection of various kind . 9 . as show by Elliott , diminution of the stock of epinephrin in the adrenal through electrical stimulation of the splanchnic be not easy to demonstrate , despite the fact that the liberation of epinephrin into the blood be notably increase by the adrenal through electrical stimulation of the splanchnic . with short period of stimulation , however , repeat over a long time at interval just long enough to prevent fatigue , a long time at interval just have prove possible to demonstrate a distinct depletion . 
1 . repeated injection into rabbit of non-hemolytic streptococcus isolate from human case of infectious endocarditis or rheumatic fever will produce a acute arthritis in the rabbit similar in most respects to the arthritis of acute rheumatism . 2 . microscopical section of the joint show a gradual transition from a acute exudative inflammation to advanced organization . 3 . endocarditis and pericarditis occur in a small percentage of human case of infectious endocarditis or rheumatic fever , and these focal lesion be frequent . these focal lesion differ considerably from Aschoff 's submiliary nodule . 4 . lesion in the kidney and liver occur but be not characteristic . 5 . by means of the vital stain the vital have be show that the large endothelioid cell which play a prominent part in the joint and myocardial lesion belong to the group of so call macrophage or wander these focal lesion and probably develop from the vascular endothelium . 
in the foregoing experiment we attempt to determine whether or not , by subject several variety of the spirochete to increase dose of certain chemotherapeutic agent , a gradual increase of resistance to the latter could be show . for this purpose , pure culture of treponema pallidum , treponema microdentium , and spirochoeta refringen be use against the action of salvarsan , neosalvarsan , bichloride of mercury , and iodine-iodide potassium solution in vitro . for the culture media , the usual ascites-broth-tissue medium as well as solid ascites-agar-tissue medium be use . after permit the spirochete to grow for a fortnight in media contain certain quantity of each drug , transfer be make from tube show various degree of growth to the next series of tube contain the same drug in still higher concentration , and similar transfer repeat every 2 week . the result of the foregoing experiment may be briefly summarize as follow : 1 . treponema pallidum and treponema pallidum , treponema microdentium have , within 3 to 4 month , increase treponema pallidum , treponema microdentium tolerance to salvarsan , neosalvarsan , bichloride of mercury , and iodine-iodide potassium solution to five and one-half time treponema pallidum , treponema microdentium original mark . with spirocha refringen a gradual increase of resistance to the latter be about three time that amount . 2 . against bichloride of mercury , the amount of increase tolerance of treponema pallidum be about 35 to 70 time the original , while that of treponema pallidum , treponema microdentium be about 10 time as much and be reach within 10 week . spirocha refringen resist 30 time the original dose . 3 . there be a unmistakable increase of resistance of the spirochete to the action of the iodine-iodide solution -lrb- lugol 's solution -rrb- when spirocha refringen be grow for several generation in fluid media contain the iodine solution , but the rate of increase between the initial and the acquire tolerance be slight . in general , the addition of Lugol `` s solution to fluid media have a weak inhibitory influence upon the growth of the spirochete , require for the total suppression of growth a quantity of over 0.7 cc . to 5 cc . of the culture media . the acquire tolerance reach be for about three time that amount . 4 . a similar tolerance phenomenon have not be establish when employ a solid instead of a fluid medium contain the drug . no explanation be offer except a suggestion that the drug hold in the agar do not enter into combination with certain tissue constituent of a fluid medium contain the drug as certain tissue constituent of  a fluid medium contain the drug be able to do with tissue element in fluid media . this may be this . 5 . the increase drug-fastness in vitro have a limit beyond which no further advance can be make . a limit beyond which no further advance can be make vary with different species of the spirochete . 6 . the acquire drug-fastness in vitro gradually disappear when the spirochete be cultivate again in the drug-free media for several generation . 
the majority of the 76 new compound possess spirocheticidal power range between and 1 : 1,000 -lrb- 30 -rrb- to 1:2,500 -lrb- 14 -rrb- , while only 2 attain the power of 1:5,000 , and 1 : 25,000 , only 2 of and 1 : 50,000 . on the other hand , 8 kill the spirochete in a dilution of and 1 : 750 , salvarsan in and 1 , 10 in 1:500 , 7 in 1:250 . 1 in and 1 : 100 , and 1 in 1:50 . it may be mention that the 2 -lrb- m1 , m4 -rrb- of 1:50,000 and and 1 -lrb- m7 -rrb- of 1:25,000 belong to the mercury compound , and that mercuric chloride kill the organism in a dilution of and 1 : 100,000 under the same experimental condition . it be also interesting to compare some of the more common chemical and therapeutic reagent . phenol be spirocheticidal in a dilution of and 1 : and 1 : 2,500 each , saponin in 1:7,500 : and 1 : 5,000 : 750 , salvarsan in and 1 , 750 , salvarsan in and 1 , salvarsan in and 1 : 7,500 , and neosalvarsan in and 1 : 2,500 . thus , of the 76 new compound there be at least 14 which have the same spirocheticidal power in vitro as have neosalvarsan . at least 14 which have the same spirocheticidal power in vitro as have neosalvarsan be of interest to note that nine compound possess the 1:1,000 each spirocheticidal power show only one-tenth of the antiseptic action when test upon bacillus dysenteria and streptococcus , while some show a even greater difference in this respect . Nos. 16 , 21 , 29 , 218 , and 244 be effective in a dilution of 1:2,500 -lrb- 14 -rrb- for spirochete , especially treponema and in a 1:100 or lower dilution for the bacterium just refer to . preparation 46 and 84 appear to exert about the same effect both on the spirochete and the bacterium just refer to , neither be very strong . Atoxyl kill the spirochete in a 1:50 dilution . one of the most striking result be obtain with various hemolytic substance . Neufeld and von Prowazek find that spirochete , especially treponema , unlike bacterium in general , be highly susceptible to the lytic action of sodium taurocholate and saponin , and Neufeld and von Prowazek consider that this phenomenon be of differential diagnostic value in determine plant and animal organism . Neufeld and von Prowazek observation be confirm by Gonder , who find , however , that spirochete , especially treponema , especially treponema , offer a great deal of resistance at the beginning , but finally undergo lysis , with Neufeld and von Prowazek cell body swollen up or macerate . in the present experiment we have find that various hemolytic substance not only bring about cytolysis of the spirochete in higher concentration , but also kill Neufeld and von Prowazek without cause a gross destruction of the cell in very high dilution ; thus , sodium cholate in and 1 : 5,000 , 5,000 and taurocholate in and 1 : 2,500 each , saponin in 1:7,500 ,    and 1 : 2,500 each , saponin in 1:7,500 , saponin in 1:7,500 . sodium oleate , one of the most powerful hemolytic agent kill the spirochete in and 1 : 7,000 , and cobra lecithide and native cobra venom in a dilution of 1:1,000 each . neither sodium nor potassium iodide display any marked spirocheticidal property -lrb- 1 : 10 in 1:500 -rrb- , while iodine in the form of Lugol 's solution be able to kill each at 1:75 . 
various carbohydrate have be add to the fluid culture of different strain of spirochete in order to determine the behavior of the latter toward various carbohydrate . in the present experiment , amygdalin , arabinose , beerwort , dextrin , galactose , glycogen , glucose , inulin , lactose , levulose , maltose , mannite , raffinose , saccharose , and starch be test with seven strain of treponema pallidum and one strain each of treponema calligyrum , treponema microdentium , treponema mucosum , and Spirochata refringen . the result may be summarize as follow : 1 . in the media contain glycogen and glucose , glycogen and glucose do not grow as vigorously as in the other sugar media , and a earlier degeneration set in . one strain of treponema pallidum and treponema calligyrum , treponema microdentium , treponema mucosum , and Spirochata refringen show a poor growth in the glycogen medium . similarly , there be little growth in the second transfer of these spirochete in the glucose medium . the growth of the spirochete in the media contain carbohydrate other than those just mention be generally good , and no difference could be distinguish between these and the control culture without any carbohydrate . the abundant growth of  treponema microdentium , treponema mucosum , which show uniform length , regular curve , and active motility somewhat better than in the sugar-free medium be the abundant growth of treponema microdentium , treponema mucosum , which show uniform length , regular curve , and active motility somewhat better than in the sugar-free medium . 2 . the height of acidity be find in the culture contain glycogen and glucose in glycogen and glucose , amount to 0.1 n 4.8 cc . for 10 cc . of the fluid culture . in the other sugar media the acidity vary between to 0.1 n 2 cc . . and 0.1 n 3.2 cc . for the same amount . in the control culture , the acidity fluctuate from 0.1 n 0.8 cc . to 0.1 n 2 cc . there be no visible alteration in the appearance of the media after the spirochete in the media contain carbohydrate other than those just mention have grow for 3 or 4 week . in the case of treponema microdenlium , a slight opalescence develop in the glycogen and glucose media after several week ' standing , but there be no precipitation or coagulation of the protein of the culture media . 3 . there be no unusual morphological change in the spirochete grow in the media contain any of the carbohydrate employ . -lrb- a -rrb- the frequent presence of the terminal appendage -lrb- or projection -rrb- in  Spirochata refringen , and in most of  treponema pallidum strain be -lrb- a -rrb- the frequent presence of the terminal appendage -lrb- or projection -rrb- in  Spirochata refringen , and in most of  treponema pallidum strain . judge from the earlier degeneration of the species in the above mention the glycogen and glucose media , these peculiar body may be interpret as indicate a phase of plasmoptysis associate with the unfavorable surroundings prior to degeneration . experimental evidence be not find for consider these spherule as a resistant or spore form of the spirochete . 
it be find that dog with a subcutaneous transplant secreting and discharge pancreatic juice externally absorb no more fat than dog in which the pancreatic remnant be undergo rapid atrophy and sclerosis . hence , the condition of the pancreatic tissue remain in the body do not influence the amount of fat absorb by the intestine . the absorption of fat by the intestinal mucous membrane be always markedly disturb when the pancreatic secretion be exclude from the intestine . after the complete removal of all pancreatic tissue from a animal , the absorption of considerable amount of fat can still take place . 
it seem , therefore , pend further field test on a larger territory , that the follow fact be fairly well establish by the above experiment . 1 . healthy turkey may be raise in a incubator from egg of infected bird . in the above experiment all remain well to August 14 , August 14 , when they be 12 week and 4 day old . the first death occur 2 week after the beginning of exposure to actual disease , when they be more than 14 week old . 2 . hen from a blackhead farm and from a farm free from healthy turkey do not convey the disease to the incubator turkey on uninfected land . 3 . the infection be either not transmit at all or only under exceptional condition by turkey in the early acute stage . the infection be probably carry and shed by those bird which have successfully pass through a attack . any definite statement concern the mode of transmission of the infection can not be make . the vehicle be unknown . the nature of the disease make the nature of  the disease probable , however , that the nature of  the disease be introduce with the food , that the nature of  the disease lodge first in one or both ceca , and that fecal matter be the vehicle . during the entire season , portion of the small intestine of all the turkey that die or be kill be section and examine both with reference to the possible presence of coccidium and of any preliminary stage of amoeba meleagridi . section be study from the upper -lrb- duodenum -rrb- , middle , and lower portion . a few coccidium cyst be find in two turkey and be refer to more in detail elsewhere . in a third turkey a intracellular parasite be see which be very minute and which differ from those usually meet with in those bird which have successfully pass through a attack . a third turkey be tentatively place with the coccidium . it be not see in any other case although search for to obtain more material for study . more material may be that we have a aberrant parasite to deal with which come from the insect eat and obtain lodgment in rare case only . the existence of any earlier stage of the blackhead parasite in the small intestine whence they move down into both ceca be contradict by the focal lesion find in both ceca and by the fact that in many case only one cecum be attack and this only in a single , restricted area . if the blackhead parasite in the small intestine whence they move down into  both ceca multiply higher up we should expect both ceca to become infected . there be some evidence point to a greater resistance of older bird than be usually present by young turkey . thus , the total mortality -lrb- include those chloroform while sick -rrb- follow exposure on the infected farm and to the yearling turkey-hen be nine out of nineteen expose , or a trifle less than 50 per cent . this figure be usually exceed among those expose immediately after hatch . the survive turkey be still well at the present time -lrb- January 1917 -rrb- . the other kind of evidence be derive from the histological examination of the lesion in the liver and ceca . in these organ the process be rather early associate with extensive infiltration of roundish cell , while the tendency to necrosis be relatively slight . the lesion of the wall of both ceca be characterize by a marked thicken of the wall with little or no necrosis and exudation of fibrin . in repeat test of the other kind of evidence the other kind of evidence will be well for the experimenter to bear in mind that they be no longer laboratory experiment but conform to natural occurrence . the infection be not isolate in pure culture but be associate in the body of the carrier with unknown factor , both normal and pathological . the virus , if such the virus may be call , may be mix with different injurious agent in different locality . the virus may be favor by various protozoan or higher parasite accidentally present , and by digestive disturbance due to improper feeding . to utilize animal infect in the natural way as a source of virus , be to put laboratory experiment into the nature of  the disease hand as far as possible without lose control of the main condition . such experiment can not , therefore , be completely reproduce at will as be possible in the laboratory with pure culture , and the result may vary from place to place . the 
of 54 sparrow examine in or near Princeton , coccidium be find in 43 , or 80 per cent . most of the negative case be encounter in November and December . in the summer and fall practically all be infect . these figure agree closely with Hadley 's , who find 79 per cent infect from May to December . culture of fece on agar show that , at least in this locality , the infect species belong to the genus isospora or diflospora and not to Eirneria . in a recent paper by Hadley 's , which come into we hand after the manuscript have go to press , the author now refer blackhead to invasion of Trichomonas . it be not possible to consider here the evidence on which this conclusion be base . 
1 . closed intestinal loop in which bacterium be present but in which tissue necrosis be prevent be compatible with life . 2 . closed intestinal loop in which be present but in which tissue necrosis be prevent , be compatible with life . 3 . closed aseptic intestinal loop in which the blood supply be completely occlude be compatible with life . 4 . the normal secretion and bacterial product of the duodenum and jejunum be not sufficiently toxic to produce any symptom when allow to drain into the abdominal cavity . 5 . we result do not support the theory of Draper of a normal toxic secretion of the duodenal mucosa , neutralize by the jejunal mucosa , or the perverted secretion theory of Whipple . 6 . bacterial activity plus necrotic tissue , or the absorption of toxic product result from the action of putrefactive bacterium on necrotic tissue be the important factor in the rapid death in simple close closed aseptic intestinal loop in which the blood supply be completely occlude . 
the power of a large number of aniline dye to restrain the growth of bacillus tuberculosis and bacillus typhosus have be determine . many substance have be find with especial restrain power for the tubercle bacillus under the condition of the test . this capacity to restrain growth in the case of the tubercle the tubercle bacillus under the condition of the test apparently bear no simple relation to true disinfectant action . opinion as to whether the active substance exert a truly specific activity against the tubercle the tubercle bacillus under the condition of the test or whether a truly specific activity against   the tubercle the tubercle bacillus under the condition of the test be determine by the peculiar condition impose by the growth of this bacterium as a surface membrane be leave for future consideration . 
Proteose injection in these dog cause vomit , vomit , and , after large dose , a excess of antithrombin with incoagulable blood . a single proteose injection , for example one-half a single proteose injection , cause abrupt clinical reaction in a normal dog with apparent complete recovery within 24 to 48 hour . the nitrogen elimination curve in a fast dog under such condition show a great rise in total urinary nitrogen . the apex of the nitrogen elimination curve in a fast dog under such condition usually fall during the second 24 hour period follow a single proteose injection . a great rise in total urinary nitrogen may be over 100 per cent increase above the mean base-line nitrogen level . a great rise in total urinary nitrogen do not fall promptly to normal but decline slowly in 3 to 5 day or more toward the original base-line -lrb- text-fig . 1 -rrb- . this speak for a definite cell injury with destruction of considerable protein substance due to a single proteose injection . the disturbance of cell equilibrium be not rapidly or promptly restore to normal . a dog which have receive previous proteose injection be partially immune or tolerant to subsequent injection of proteose . these dog , as a rule , show less intense clinical reaction and less rise in the curve of nitrogen elimination follow a unit dose of standard proteose as compare with normal or non-immune control . the proteose use in these experiment be prepare as describe from material obtain in case of intestinal obstruction or of closed intestinal loop . these experiment explain the sharp rise in blood non-protein nitrogen which follow within a few hour the injection of a toxic proteose . they also point to the correct explanation of the high non-protein nitrogen of the blood find in intestinal obstruction or with closed intestinal loop . 
dog with isolate loop of small intestine show many evidence of intoxication . a study of the total nitrogen elimination show a great rise above the normal base-line minimum of the fasting period -lrb- Table II -rrb- . this mean that the intoxication be associate with a great destruction of body protein , and explain the high non-protein nitrogen of the blood which be observe and report previously -lrb- 2 -rrb- . injection of a proteose obtain from a closed intestinal loop will cause a similar rise in the nitrogen elimination curve . this furnish more evidence that the intoxication observe in association with a closed intestinal loop be in reality a proteose intoxication . dog inject with sublethal dose of proteose will show a definite tolerance to subsequent injection , and will show much less acute intoxication after the isolation of a closed intestinal loop -lrb- Table 1 -rrb- . these immune or tolerant dog show a much less pronounced rise in the nitrogen elimination curve during proteose intoxication of any type . this indicate that the tolerance or immunity to proteose give more protection for the body protein against the injury which these toxic proteose inflict upon the body cell . complete duodenal obstruction combine with a gastrojejunostomy give a chronic type of intestinal obstruction associate with little vomiting , which be peculiarly suit to metabolism study -lrb- Table iv -rrb- . such duodenal obstruction show a definite and sustained rise in the curve of nitrogen elimination above the normal base-line level . these immune or tolerant dog , too , be tolerant to injection of standard toxic proteose . control ether anesthesia experiment show little if any rise in the curve of nitrogen elimination -lrb- Table VI -rrb- . control laparotomy experiment show a definite rise in the curve of nitrogen elimination -lrb- Table VI -rrb- , but a rise which be small compare with a definite rise in     the curve of nitrogen elimination -lrb- Table VI -rrb- note in the intoxication of duodenal obstruction or of isolate intestinal loop . it be probable that the tissue injury and disintegration associate with the wound reaction be responsible for the general reaction . we may assume that protein split product from the wound area be absorb and be responsible for the general reaction observe . we propose to assume that the intoxication here study be associate with a definite proteose intoxication , which be capable of initiate and continue a profound injury of tissue protein . one index of a profound injury of tissue protein be the great and sustained rise in the curve of total nitrogen elimination . 
the cerebrospinal fluid take very early and quite late in the course of acute poliomyelitis exhibit no neutralize action on filter poliomyelitic virus . the blood serum on the 6th day of the disease already contain the neutralize principle . the injection of sterile horse serum into the cerebrospinal meninx in monkey increase monkey permeability , so that monkey permit the immunity neutralize the neutralize principle passively inject into the blood to pass into the cerebrospinal fluid take very early and quite late in the course of acute poliomyelitis . the passage in passively immunize monkey take place during a relatively brief space of time and apparently only while the inflammatory reaction produce by the horse serum be at the inflammatory reaction produce by the horse serum height . the passage in passively immunize monkey be establish for monkey and render probable for man that the intraspinal injection of immune serum in acute poliomyelitis be curative . in monkey normal serum exert no such action , and at present nothing can be state definitely regard the therapeutic effect of normal serum in man except that probably any benefit which may arise from no such action employment would be attributable not to the action of the serum as such , but to the escape of circulate the immunity principle make possible by the aseptic inflammation set up by the blood in the cerebrospinal meninx in monkey . as the immunity principle appear in the blood only after several day , and the report favorable effect of the immune serum treatment relate to the first day of illness , the employment of normal serum be thus not indicate , while that of a immune serum be . 
1 . the result of 56 experiment have show that washing of the nasal and pharyngeal mucosa possess definite power to inactivate or neutralize the active virus of poliomyelitis . 2 . this power be not absolutely fix , but be subject to fluctuation in a give person . apparently inflammatory condition of the upper air passage tend to remove or diminish the power of neutralization . but irregularity have be note , even in the absence of these condition . 3 . too few test have be make thus far to ascertain whether adult and child differ with respect to the existence of this neutralize property in the nasal secretion . while the inactivate property be absent from the secretion of one child during the first day of poliomyelitis , it be present in another to whom immune serum be administer , and in still another on the 15th day of illness when convalescence be establish . 4 . the neutralize substance be water-soluble and appear not to be inorganic ; it appear to be more or less thermolabile , and the neutralize substance action do not depend upon the presence of mucin as such . 5 . it be suggest that the production of healthy carrier through contamination with poliomyelitis may be determine by the presence or absence of this inactivate or neutralize property in the secretion of one child . whether this effect operate to prevent actual invasion of the virus and production of infection can only be conject . probably accessory and not the essential element on which defense against infection rest . it be more probable that other factor exist which help to determine the issue of the delicate adjustment between contamination and infection . 
among the mechanism which defend the body from infection with the virus of epidemic poliomyelitis be the meningeal-choroid plexus complex , which normally be capable of exclude the circulate virus from the central nervous organ . the meningeal-choroid plexus complex play a part also in prevent infection from virus present upon the nasal mucosa . aseptic fluid which irritate , inflame , or even slightly alter the integrity of the meninx and choroid plexus diminish or remove they protective function . normal monkey or horse serum , isotonic salt solution , and Ringer 's and Locke 's solution , when inject into the meninx , promote infection with epidemic poliomyelitis introduce into the blood , the nose , or the subcutaneous tissue . simple lumbar puncture and the withdrawal and return of the cerebrospinal fluid in normal monkey , hemorrhage have be absolutely avoid , do not promote infection with    epidemic poliomyelitis inject into the blood ; while the replacement of the cerebrospinal fluid of one monkey with that of another do in some instance lead to infection . simple lumbar puncture attend with even very slight hemorrhage open the way for the passage of the virus from the blood into the central nervous tissue , and thus promote infection . hence , change in the structure or function of the meningealchoroid plexus complex , too slight to be detect by chemical and cellular change in the cerebrospinal fluid in normal monkey or by morphological alteration , suffice to diminish in a essential manner a essential manner protective power . of all the irritant fluid test , immune serum alone inject into the meninx be not succeed by infection from the virus introduce into the blood . the protective property of the immune serum be capable of overcome the promote action of normal monkey and horse serum and the other irritant mention . the importance first of the meningeal-choroid plexus complex in prevent infection with epidemic poliomyelitis , and next of immune serum in offset the disadvantage and danger arise from defect in the mechanism be apparent , as be the bearing of the experiment report on the serum therapy of epidemic poliomyelitis . 
the virus of experimental poliomyelitis contain within the spinal cord and medullum of human being and monkey withstand glycerolation for many year . the specimen test have be keep for year at refrigerator temperature . the symptom and lesion cause by the virus of poliomyelitis be identical with those produce by that contain in the more recently collect spinal cord and medullum . the specimen test have lose a part of those produce by that contain in the more recently collect spinal cord and medullum activity under the condition describe , necessitate larger and repeat dose to induce infection . whether this difference be due merely to quantitative reduction in number of viable microorganism or to qualitative alteration under the influence of the mildly antiseptic glycerol have not be determine . a ineffective inoculation of tissue contain the virus of poliomyelitis do not increase resistance , but rather diminish a ineffective inoculation of tissue contain  the virus of poliomyelitis , so that a subsequent injection , inadequate in a subsequent injection , may cause experimental poliomyelitis . this power of survival under adverse condition may not be without significance in respect to the recrudescence of poliomyelitis in a give locality and after a lapse of year . hitherto this phenomenon have be account for by assume a fresh importation of a virus of pronounced pathogenic power . it be possible that the explanation in some instance reside in the renew activity of specimen of the virus survive from a previous epidemic , while in other instance a fresh introduction actually take place from a remote focus of infection . the infectious nervous tissue employ in these experiment do not yield in culture streptococcus or other ordinary bacterium . 
two additional culture of the globoid body , obtain from the nervous tissue of monkey in which experimental poliomyelitis be produce , and identical with the original culture describe by Flexner and Noguchi , be report in this paper . the highly parasitic culture , like treponema pallidum , be refractory to artificial cultivation . after long cultivation outside the body , the globoid body acquire saprophytic property and then grow more readily and in a considerable variety of media , provide , however , that monkey in which experimental poliomyelitis be produce , and identical with the original culture describe by Flexner and Noguchi carry a certain quantity of protein matter not denature . the rabbit respond slightly with the production of antibody to the injection of the globoid body . the monkey respond only occasionally under the same condition and apparently only when two additional culture of globoid body , obtain from the nervous tissue of monkey in which experimental poliomyelitis be produce , and identical with the original culture describe by Flexner and Noguchi be inject into the central nervous system . this response be small and at most lead to slight reaction of agglutination and complement deviation with two additional culture of globoid body , obtain from the nervous tissue of monkey in which experimental poliomyelitis be produce , and identical with the original culture describe by Flexner and Noguchi . the serum obtain from monkey recover from experimental poliomyelitis show even less agglutination and agglutination and complement deviation . the maximal agglutinative and morphological change produce in the globoid body cultivate in immune monkey serum be obtain in the first generation ; after several subculture in the immune serum , the reversion to normal take place in one generation in a non-immune medium . the serum of human being in the acute or early subacute stage of experimental poliomyelitis give no complement deviation with the antigen derive from the globoid body . the cultivation of the saprophytized globoid body through several generation in immune monkey or human serum do not confer upon several generation in immune monkey or human serum pathogenic property for monkey recover from  experimental poliomyelitis . the serum of human being and monkey which have survive attack of experimental poliomyelitis do not fix complement in the presence of antigen prepare from organ of the monkey succumb to the experimental disease . the globoid body and treponema pallidum present many analogy in cultural , immunological , and pathogenic property . 
Streptococci cultivate from the tonsil of thirty-two case of true experimental poliomyelitis . in no case be a condition induce resemble true experimental poliomyelitis clinically or pathologically in guinea pig , dog , cat , the rabbit , or monkey which succumb to inoculation with the filtered virus . on the other hand , a considerable percentage of the rabbit and a smaller percentage of some of the other animal develop these lesion due to Streptococci . these lesion consist of meningitis , meningo-encephalitis , abscess of the brain , arthritis , tenosynovitis , myositis , abscess of the kidney , endocarditis , pericarditis , and neuritis . no distinction in the character or frequency of these lesion could be determine between the streptococcus derive from poliomyelitic patient and from other source . Streptococci isolate from the poliomyelitic brain and spinal cord of monkey which succumb to inoculation with the filtered virus fail to induce in monkey any paralysis or the characteristic histological change of true experimental poliomyelitis . Streptococci isolate from the poliomyelitic brain and spinal cord of monkey which succumb to inoculation with the filtered virus be regard as secondary bacterial invader of the nervous organ . monkey which have recover from infection with streptococcus derive from true experimental poliomyelitis be not protect from infection with the filtered virus , and monkey which have recover from infection with streptococcus derive from   true experimental poliomyelitis blood do not neutralize the filtered virus in vitro . we have fail to detect any etiologic or pathologic relationship between Streptococci and true experimental poliomyelitis in man or true experimental poliomyelitis in the monkey . 
1 . the case may be employ in the serum treatment and probably yield the best result . 2 . when sterile for ordinary bacterium , free of corpuscle and hemoglobin , and when inject by the gravity method , observe well known rule of caution , the gravity method may be employ without danger . 3 . the serum should be inject both intraspinally and intravenously , the latter either directly or by way of the subcutaneous tissue . 4 . the earlier in the course of the disease the serum be employ in suitable dose , the more promise there be of benefit . 5 . the action of the serum appear to be more precise and definite in arrest paralysis than in rapidly bring about the action of  the serum retrogression . 6 . the decision to employ the serum should rest upon a clinical examination support by the result of the microscopic and chemical study of the cerebrospinal fluid . 7 . the question of multiple and repeated injection of the serum have not yet be work out . in the case here report and especially in the group in which no paralysis exist at the time of the first injection , the first injection either do not progress at all , or where there be extension , as in case 14 and 15 , the upper segment of the spinal cord become rapidly involve , and be follow by respiratory paralysis and death . probably in case in which some degree of muscular weakness develop soon after the injection of serum , reinjection 12 to 24 hour later may be advantageous . the temperature curve may serve to indicate the time for reinjection . 8 . the favorable result thus far achieve in human being by means of the immune serum support and extend those obtain experimentally in monkey and indicate , as be foresee , that the milder or less fatal form of poliomyelitis appear in man be even more amenable to the serum treatment than be the highly fatal disease produce by inoculation in monkey . 
we have not find in the literature a report of a instance of permanent homoio or autotransplantation of the spleen , or of the probably closely related spleno and hemolymph gland . spleen autotransplant with considerable difficulty as compare with thyroid , parathyroid , ovary , or adrenal cortex . this may be due to this complex anatomical structure . a instance of a permanent autotransplant have be observe . none of we attempt to homoiotransplant a instance of a permanent autotransplant be successful beyond the usual taking and persistence for 2 or 3 week , common to all homoiograft . the successful permanent subcutaneous autotransplantation have all the morphological characteristic of a fully differentiate and functionally active spleen . this method of transplantation would seem to offer a means of learn more of the normal development , regeneration , and function of this complex tissue . 
horse immunize to type i pneumococcus develop 0.1 cc . of which protect against 0.5 cc . of a virulent culture , 0.000001 cc . of which kill mouse in less than 40 hour . protective test of serum from horse immunize to type ii organism vary ,  0.1 cc . protect , however , in certain instance against 0.1 and 0.01 cc . of virulent homologous culture . type i and ii serum obtain in we experiment with culture sediment and whole culture do not vary markedly for a give type and correspond closely in they protective titer with sample of serum receive from the Rockefeller Institute Hospital . ii be therefore evident that the follow minimum standard of  0.1 cc . of this serum . of virulent culture can and should be maintain when serum be to be use for the treatment of case . by further study and comparison of these different method of immunization it be hope that serum of greater potency may be produce , but as yet this have only be accomplish in exceptional instance . a horse immunize with type iii -lrb- pneumococcus mucosus -rrb- develop serum have a slight degree of protection for mouse against the corresponding organism . this serum be sufficiently potent , however , to cause prompt and complete agglutination when combine with fresh untreated homologous organism , thus avoid the preliminary treatment to remove the capsule which have previously be hold necessary . as a diagnostic aid in the differentiation of pneumococcus strain , this serum have prove of distinct value . 
a simple method be present by which , with the diffusion of trypan blue into the nucleus as a criterion of cell injury , it be possible to study quantitatively the effect of various agency upon the small thymus cell and upon the tissue lymphocyte . preliminary study with a simple method have lead we to the follow conclusion , which , however , unless otherwise state , may be take as apply only to the lymphocyte of the rat thymus . 1 . the small thymus cell , when suspend in balanced phosphate solution , show no distinct reaction to variation in hydrogen ion concentration range between p -lrb- h -rrb- 7.0 and p -lrb- h -rrb- 7.8 . beyond p -lrb- h -rrb- 7.0 7.0 there be a sudden increase in the permeability of the small thymus cell dye ; plasmolysis of the small thymus cell occur when the alkalinity exceed p -lrb- h -rrb- 8.0 . 2 . heating to 49 degree or 50 degree c. be accompany by a critical increase in the permeability of    the small thymus cell to the small thymus cell dye . 3 . the injury cause by lack of oxygen can be demonstrate by the increase in the number of stain the small thymus cell . 4 . the addition of serum to suspension of thymus cell or tonsil lymphocyte greatly inhibit the diffusion of trypan blue into the small thymus cell . the protection afford be roughly proportionate to the amount of serum add . gelatin also exert a marked protective influence ; egg albumin afford a partial protection ; starch and gum arabic be inert . hemoglobin and cholesterol do not modify the stainability of the small thymus cell . arsenious sulfide in weak concentration partially inhibit the small thymus cell dye . Colloidal iron be without effect , and be precipitated about the small thymus cell . 5 . the toxicity of the photodynamic substance , hematoporphyrin , and of a impure chlorophyll solution in the presence of sunlight could be strikingly demonstrate by the greatly increase permeability of the small thymus cell stain . 6 . acute and chronic inanition produce a increase fragility of the small thymus cell . the protective power of the serum in acute starvation appear to be increase . 7 . the small thymus cell of old animal be more readily injure than be those of young one , as indicate by the increase proportion of stain the small thymus cell . 8 . a simple method have be apply to the demonstration of the action of cytotoxic immune serum for rat thymus cell and for human tonsil lymphocyte in vitro . further experiment deal with the question of specificity be in progress . the cytotoxin be inactivate by the addition of complement . Thermostabile cytagglutinin have also be produce . 
the phagocytosis of red corpuscle , while frequent in the normal dog , rat , and guinea pig , be slight in man , the rhesus monkey , and many rabbit . in cat the phagocytosis of red corpuscle be always negligible in amount and frequently absent . phagocytosis will not suffice as a general explanation of normal blood destruction . when the liver , spleen , and bone marrow of the cat , dog , rabbit , or monkey be slowly perfuse with defibrinate blood or Locke `` s solution , these body be give off into the fluid which have the appearance of red corpuscle that have lose the cat , dog , rabbit , or monkey hemoglobin but retain the rest of the cat , dog , rabbit , or monkey cell substance . these body possess many of the property supposedly distinctive of red corpuscle . many of the property supposedly distinctive of  red corpuscle be the product of disorder parenchymal cell . by a special method , a special method have prove possible to search the body , organ by organ , and the circulate blood also , for disintegrate red corpuscle . shadow of red cell be not present anywhere , nor be hemolyze red cell find . a hemolytic process , in the ordinary sense of the term , can scarcely play a . important part in normal blood destruction . instead , it be certain that some red corpuscle , at least , be destroy in another way ; namely , by fragmentation . normal blood regularly contain small number of fragmentation forms-microcyte and poikilocytes-and accumulation of a be regularly present in the spleen , but be find only inconstantly in the other organ . the fragment be in evident process of further subdivision . a occur not only in species in which a important process -lrb- dog , some rabbit -rrb- be negligible -lrb- cat -rrb- , but also in animal in which a important process -lrb- dog , some rabbit -rrb- be a important process -lrb- dog , some rabbit -rrb- . the method of study that we have employ be well suit to disclose how the circulate blood be destroy . the importance of cell fragmentation in this connection be indicate by we failure to find any other means of destruction , save only the phagocytosis already know . further fact indicate the importance of cell fragmentation in this connection be present in we second paper , where a general discussion will also be find . 
1 . the increase destruction of red cell in animal render plethoric by transfusion take place predominantly by a fragmentation of the corpuscle without loss of hemoglobin . 2 . the microcyte and poikilocyte observe in animal with a severe anemia due to hemorrhage be not put forth as such by the bone marrow , but be portion of red cell in animal render plethoric by transfusion fragment while circulate . 3 . the cell thus fragmented be for the most part those newformed to meet the exigency of the situation . such cell be in large part unable to withstand the wear and tear of function . there result a vicious circle . a severe anemia due to hemorrhage render the bone marrow unable to put forth proper cell , and a severe anemia due to hemorrhage do produce be soon destroy , thus prolong the condition . a similar state of affair probably exist in many human anemia . 4 . the occurrence of large accumulation of microcyte and poikilocyte in the spleen of anemic and plethoric animal indicate that the organ exercise some important function in connection with these form . the same be true of normal animal , for the finding in microcyte and poikilocyte in the spleen of anemic and plethoric animal be similar , though less striking . 5 . the normal fate of the red corpuscle , in those species in which phagocytosis be negligible , be to be fragmented one by one , while still circulate , to a fine , hemoglobin-containing dust . the cell fragment be rapidly remove from the blood , but microcyte and poikilocyte in the spleen of anemic and plethoric animal ultimate fate remain to be determine . the fact indicate that microcyte and poikilocyte in the spleen of anemic and plethoric animal be remove from the blood by the spleen of anemic and plethoric animal , and under exceptional condition , by the bone marrow . 
blood destruction due to a single injury , as by sodium oleate , or act through a short period of time , as by toluylenediamine or hemolytic immune serum , be not characterize , in the absence of hemoglobinurium , by a increase elimination of iron in the urine . this hold , not only for the evanescent injury cause by sodium oleate , but also for the severe type cause by hemolytic immune serum , in which a progressive destruction of the blood may persist for 2 week or more with constant evidence of the disintegration of erythrocyte as show by bile pigment in the urine . this finding be in accord with previous investigation of anemia in both man and animal . likewise , no striking increase be evident , under such circumstance , in the percentage of iron excrete in the fece . the total amount of iron in the fece have be notably increase in two experiment with hemolytic serum , but as the percentage of iron excrete in the fece be not appreciably alter , the difference depend presumably on variation in the bulk of the fece rather than upon a increase elimination of iron in the urine . this evidence of the power of the body to conserve the iron rephagocytosis be negligible , be to be fragmented one by one , while still circulate , to a fine , hemoglobin-containing dust . the cell fragment be rapidly remove from the blood , but they ultimate fate remain to be determine . the fact indicate that they be remove from the blood by the spleen , and under exceptional condition , by the bone marrow . 
1 . the presence of a acidosis in dog with experimental uranium nephritis be demonstrable by the Van Slyke-Stillman-Cullen method and that of Marriott . the presence of a acidosis in dog with experimental uranium nephritis be detect more readily by the former method . 2 . a acidosis in dog with experimental uranium nephritis be associate with increase in the blood urea and plasma chloride and with the appearance of albumin and cast in the urine . 3 . the oral administration of sodium bicarbonate diminish a acidosis in dog with experimental uranium nephritis , plasma chloride , the amount of albumin and cast in the urine , and , to a lesser degree , the increase in the blood urea follow the administration of uranium . the oral administration of sodium bicarbonate also diminish the severity of the change produce by uranium in the kidney . 4 . the oral administration of sodium bicarbonate to normal dog raise the carbon dioxide content of the plasma as determine by the . Van Slyke-Stillman-Cullen method . 
the effect of Strophanthin and of Digitalis . 1 . in intact dog the dose which cause slow and other sign of vagus stimulation without cause ectopic contraction usually lay between 30 and 40 per cent of the minimum lethal dose for Thoms g-strophanthin and for digipuratum and a fluid extract of digitali , give intravenously in dilute solution in about 15 minute . 2 . in dog strophanthin and digitali when give intravenously produce typical alteration in the electrocardiogram almost immediately and with equal rapidity . 3 . in this series the change in the electrocardiogram follow the administration of 25 to 40 per cent of the minimum lethal dose of dog strophanthin and digitali when give intravenously produce typical alteration in the electrocardiogram almost immediately and with equal rapidity often pass off within a hour or two and with few exception be not visible in electrocardiogram take 20 hour later . the effect of Strophanthin and of Digitalis . do not appear to be more lasting than those of strophanthin . as there be marked difference in the persistence of the action of each of these drug within the effect of Strophanthin and of Digitalis . own series , this conclusion be provisional . 4 . a persistent auriculoventricular block -lrb- without the occurrence of ectopic beat -rrb- be obtain only exceptionally , but the administration of between 30 and 40 per cent of the minimum lethal dose for Thoms g-strophanthin and for digipuratum and a fluid extract of digitali to 40 per cent of the minimum lethal dose of either of these drug within the effect of Strophanthin and of Digitalis . own series be usually follow by the occurrence of ectopic beat either singly or together of occasional auriculoventricular block or exaggerated sinus arrhythmium or sinus block , and by pronounced slowing of the sinus rate . 5 . occasionally , with or without previous slowing or the occurrence of ectopic beat , these dose cause a marked acceleration of the sinus rate . 6 . the auriculoventricular -lrb- p-r -rrb- time be usually lengthen but may be shorten . 7 . the p wave may become less positive , isoelectric , or negative . 8 . the t wave most often become negative before or during the stage of slow but frequently become or remain positive during the stage of slow . when the sinus rate increase or when occasional ectopic beat occur , the t wave almost always become decidedly more positive . at time the sinus rate vary rapidly and decidedly within a period of a few seconds . 9 . ectopic ventricular beat occur in a number of instance after dose range from 19 to 40 per cent of the minimum lethal dose of either of  these drug within the effect of Strophanthin and of Digitalis . own series , and usually but not always when more than 40 per cent have be inject within 15 to 30 minute . 10 . previous administration of either of these drug within the effect of Strophanthin and of Digitalis . own series do not appear to cause either a quantitative or qualitative alteration in the reaction of the heart to Amyl Nitrite -lrb- with the exception that such previous administration appear responsible for the fact that in one experiment the inhalation of Amyl Nitrite , and in two other the injection of atropine , be follow by the occurrence of ectopic beat -rrb- . the effect of Amyl Nitrite . 1 . in intact dog , both before and after the administration of between 30 and 40 per cent of the minimum lethal dose for Thoms g-strophanthin and for digipuratum and a fluid extract of digitali to 40 per cent of the minimum lethal dose of either of  these drug within the effect of Strophanthin and of Digitalis . own series of strophanthin or of digitali , Amyl Nitrite usually cause at first -lrb- probably largely reflexly -rrb- a pronounced increase of vagus tone show by slow of the sinus rate -rrb- exaggerate sinus arrhythmium , or auriculoventricular block . later the sinus rate be accelerate and arrhythmium or block disappear -lrb- probably due to vasodilatation and diminish vagus tone -rrb- . 2 . the auriculoventricular -lrb- p-r -rrb- time be usually lengthen at first -lrb- probably largely reflexly -rrb- a pronounced increase of vagus tone show by slow of   the sinus rate -rrb- exaggerate sinus arrhythmium and later be shorten . 3 . the p wave often at first -lrb- probably largely reflexly -rrb- a pronounced increase of vagus tone show by slow of   the sinus rate -rrb- exaggerate sinus arrhythmium become shorter , isoelectric , or negative , but later become much more positive . 4 . the t wave at first -lrb- probably largely reflexly -rrb- a pronounced increase of vagus tone show by slow of   the sinus rate -rrb- exaggerate sinus arrhythmium often become less positive or more negative , but later become strongly positive . 5 . when the previous administration of not too large dose of dog strophanthin and digitali when give intravenously produce typical alteration in the electrocardiogram almost immediately and with equal rapidity cause the occurrence of ectopic ventricular beat , Amyl Nitrite usually cause dog strophanthin and digitali when give intravenously produce typical alteration in the electrocardiogram almost immediately and with equal rapidity temporary disappearance . even when large dose of these drug within the effect of Strophanthin and of Digitalis . own series cause a constant succession of ectopic contraction of various type , a constant succession of ectopic contraction of various type the inhalation of amyl nitrite , and in two other the injection of atropine be often follow by a temporary return of nomotopic cycle or by a change in the form of the ventricular complex so that dog strophanthin and digitali when give intravenously produce typical alteration in the electrocardiogram almost immediately and with equal rapidity more closely resemble that of nomotopic one . 6 . only large amount of Amyl Nitrite appear to 
the principal point bring out in the present article be the principal point bring out in the present article . 1 . Wild rat capture in this country carry in they kidney a spirochete which possess the morphological and pathogenic property characteristic of spirochata icterohamorrhagia discover by Inada in the japanese form of infectious jaundice . 2 . culture of the American , belgian , and japanese strain of a spirochete which possess the morphological and pathogenic property characteristic of spirochata icterohamorrhagia discover by Inada in the japanese form of infectious jaundice be obtain by a special technique describe , the first two strain have be cultivate artificially for the first time . 3 . animal actively immunize against the japanese strain resist inoculation , not only of the same strain , but also of the belgian and american strain . the belgian strain produce immunity equally effective against all three strain . experiment to . ascertain whether the immunity afford by the american strain also protect against the japanese and belgian strain be in progress . 4 . these finding warrant the conclusion that the spirochete designate here as the belgian and american strain be probably identical . 5 . on account of 5 distinctive feature , a new genus , leptospira , have be suggest as the designation of this organism . 
experiment be carry out for the study of culture spirochete in they relation to various immunity reaction in vitro . several strain of treponema pallidum and one each of treponema calligyrum , spirochata refringens , treponema microdentium , and treponema mucosum be use . test be make of immune substance responsible for agglutination , complement fixation , spirocheticidosis , and opsonization . in case of agglutination and complement fixation , cross titration be make . 1 . in the serum derive from rabbit immunize with various spirochete agglutinin be demonstrate in vary quantity for the homologous antigen . the amount of agglutinin develop be considerably higher in treponema pallidum immune serum than in the other group . there be no parallelism between the amount of antigen inject and the amount of agglutinin develop . 2 . Cross titration among different pallidum several strain of treponema pallidum and one each of treponema calligyrum , spirochata refringens , treponema microdentium , and treponema mucosum reveal that the agglutiantion be not necessarily strongest when the homologous antigen and immune serum be bring together . 3 . on the other hand , the reaction between the immune serum which have be preserve aseptically in a refrigerator -lrb- 6 degree c. -rrb- during the same period and antigen belong to different species be sufficiently specific to justify the grouping . 4 . certain degree of group reaction be observe between treponema pallidum immune serum and the calligyrum , while the affinity between the calligyrum and refringe , and possibly also between the calligyrum and mucosum in a much smaller degree , seem close , and  immune serum and  the calligyrum , while the affinity between the calligyrum and refringe , and possibly also between the calligyrum and mucosum in a much smaller degree , seem close immune serum versa . there be a much more pronounced group reaction between the calligyrum , while the affinity between the calligyrum and refringe , and possibly also between the calligyrum and mucosum in a much smaller degree , seem close   . the immune serum and antigen of spirochata refringens , treponema microdentium show a slight affinity for the mucosum but none but none for treponema pallidum , calligyrum , or   , while the mucosum immune serum cause a slight agglutination with many member of the other group . hence , it appear that treponema pallidum be more or less related to the calligyrum , while the affinity between the calligyrum and refringe , and possibly also between the calligyrum and mucosum in a much smaller degree , seem close , while possibly also

seem close , and possibly also between the calligyrum and mucosum in a much smaller degree , seem close , seem close . spirochata refringens , treponema microdentium show the least relation to any other spirochete . 5 . titration of agglutinin in the serum obtain 3 month after the cessation of immunization reveal that the agglutinin contents be already greatly reduce , have fall roughly to 0.01 of the original strenght . the rate of disappearance be irregular in different animal and bear no direct relation to the initial titer . titration make of the immune serum which have be preserve aseptically in a refrigerator -lrb- 6 degree c. 6 -rrb- during the same period -lrb- 3 month -rrb- indicate that the original strength of the immune serum which have be preserve aseptically in a refrigerator -lrb- 6 degree c. -rrb- during the same period be reduce to about one-tenth . the agglutinin for various spirochete disappear from the rabbit 's body much more rapidly than the agglutinin for various spirochete be reduce in the separated serum by deterioration on standing at 6 degree c. 6 . titration of the immune serum for complement fixation power show with a few exception , in which there be only slight complement binding , that the initial titer be high enough to indicate the presence of this principle . the anti-pallidum serum possess higher average titer than the other immune serum test with the homologous antigen . the least active be the least active . 7 . Cross titration of anti-pallidum immune serum for complement fixation show that a give serum with a high titer for Cross titration of anti-pallidum immune serum for  complement fixation own strain of antigen be also strong with most of the other strain of treponema pallidum . instance occur also in which the titer with heterologous pallidum the homologous antigen fall far below those of the homologous .

four different variety of easily cultivate microorganism have be culture from the cerebrospinal fluid and acute anterior poliomyelitis . it be not contend that be all inherent in the tissue ; a part be doubtless extraneous . the streptococcus and diplococd may be consider as the most significant of the bacterium cultivate and be distinguishable from each other by biological test . the streptococcus grow both aerobically and anaerobically ; under anaerobic condition growth be slow , the coccus become small and round , and be more easily decolorize with alcohol in the gram stain . be not find in the anaerobic culture of 106 cerebrospinal fluid ; be find in one of twenty anaerobic blood culture and frequently in the cerebrum , cerebellum , pon and medullum , cord , mesenteric gland of fatal case , mesenteric gland of fatal case , liver , mesenteric gland of fatal case , spleen , pancreas , thymus gland , mesenteric gland of fatal case , and mesenteric gland of fatal case . Diplococci be gram-positive and , transplant to solid media , yield luxuriant growth and a staphylococcus grouping . transplant grow aerobically and anaerobically , but more slowly under the latter condition , and the coccus become smaller and more round . Diplococci be find in the anaerobic culture of 48 of 106 cerebrospinal fluid ; also in the cerebrum , cerebellum -rrb- pon and medullum , cord , mesenteric gland of fatal case , mesenteric gland of fatal case , liver , mesenteric gland of fatal case , spleen , pancreas , and mesenteric gland of fatal case of fatal case . the filtrate of emulsion of tissue contain streptococcus and diplococcus pass through fine Kitasato and Pasteur-Chamberland filter be sterile unless large amount of the filtrate of emulsion of tissue contain streptococcus and diplococcus pass through fine Kitasato and Pasteur-Chamberland filter be collect . the amount of filtrate collect and culture be therefore of considerable importance in filtration experiment . the small form of streptococcus and diplococcus in old anaerobic culture be filterable with fine Kitasato and Pasteur-Chamberland filter , while young aerobic culture contain large form be not , unless large amount of culture be filter . intracranial , intravenous , and intraperitoneal injection of these easily cultivate streptococcus , these easily cultivate streptococcus fail to produce paralysis in rabbit or monkey . with two exception all the culture be transplant from the original anaerobic ascites-broth-kidney culture of cerebrospinal fluid and various tissue . Arthritis and meningitis be produce by the streptococcus , but there be neither clinical iior histological evidence of acute anterior poliomyelitis . occasional bacteriological study since 1898 have show that easily cultivate micrococcus and  these easily cultivate streptococcus may be present in the cerebrospinal fluid and tissue of the central nervous system of person suffer with acute anterior poliomyelitis . the majority of secondary invader have find the cerebrospinal fluid , blood , and nervous organ sterile . opinion have vary in regard to the significance of the organism and cultivate micrococcus in particular , but the consensus of opinion have be to the effect that secondary invader be secondary invader and unable of secondary invader to produce poliomyelitis in the lower animal . after allow for contamination due to technical error in secure specimen , the total number of observation indicate that cultivate micrococcus and  these easily cultivate streptococcus occur sometimes in the brain and cord of person suffer from acute anterior poliomyelitis . occasional bacteriological study since 1898 have show that contamination due to technical error may be find not only in these location , but also in the spleen , mesenteric gland of fatal case , mesenteric gland of fatal case , and other organ . it be not know that contamination due to technical error exert a influence in this disease , although contamination due to technical error may possibly give rise to the production of antibody -rrb- assume contamination due to technical error entrance not to be wholly agonal , as the culture of the streptococcus be frequently of sufficient virulence to produce meningitis in rabbit or monkey . filtration experiment be in accord with those of other investigator who find that easily cultivate microorganism do not produce poliomyelitis in the lower animal , and be therefore in sharp contrast with the recent report which would attribute a etiologic relationship of str 
we have establish the fact that the chrome reaction as well as the silver and osmium reaction be merely reduction by adrenalin . in we opinion the naming of the cell give a positive reaction should not be base upon a positive reaction chromaffin cell , chromaffin cell -rrb- , but on the presence of adrenalin we opinion . Biedl 's term , adrenal cell , adrenal organ , adrenal body , adrenal system , and also Bonnamour 's term , adrenalin-producing cell , be appropriate in this respect . we propose the name adrenalin cell , adrenalin tissue , adrenalin system , thereby indicate the presence of adrenalin we opinion . 
1 . the spore of bacillus welchius be find on 100 per cent of the uniform of belgian soldier who have come directly from the trench , and in the mesh of all the sample examine of the new cloth from which the uniform of belgian soldier be make . 2 . in fifteen out of twenty fresh war wound member of      the spore of bacillus welchius be find . of the fifteen patient , only three later develop gas gangrene . once the spore of bacillus welchius have be carry into a wound the deep-lying lacerated muscle tissue appear to be the most important factor in the onset of gas gangrene . 3 . bacillus welchius be able to grow and produce gas in broth contain up to 40 per cent saccharose . some strain be able to multiply and produce gas in 50 per cent saccharose broth ; but none of those examine be able to grow when the concentration of the sugar reach 60 per cent . 4 . the bubbling of pure oxygen through milk or dextrose broth culture of bacillus welchius have a definite depressor action on the production of gas . this do not appear to be-due to a reduce number of organism in the culture . 
1 . in these study several phase of the predpitm reaction be investigate by the use of purify protein as antigen . these preparation be these preparation these preparation . the ovalbumin , isolate by the method of Hopkins and Pinkus , . be apparently as pure as be obtainable by chemical mean . this albumin , however , produce moderately severe anaphylactic reaction in animal sensitize with ovoglobulin . anaphylactic test of the individuality of a protein can not be any longer regard as the criterion of the purity of the substance as a antigen . Wells and Osborne have show that these protein may have a common antigenic group which cause mutual anaphylactic reaction in animal sensitize to these protein . in particular , as a mixture of these protein , one of which be undoubtedly egg albumin be a mixture of these protein , one of which be undoubtedly egg albumin , anaphylaxi produce by injection of albumin into animal sensitize to the so call globulin offer no evidence for or against the purity of egg albumin . the character of the curve show in text-fig . 1 confirm the assumption , base upon chemical datum , that crystalline egg albumin be a single protein . 2 . with edestin and crystalline egg albumin as antigen phase in the precipitin reaction be find in which these substance and they specific precipitin could be demonstrate to be coexistent but ununited in the same serum . 3 . when edestin or crystalline egg albumin be inject into a rabbit immunize thereto , a antigen may be find in the circulate blood during 48 hour after a rabbit immunize thereto injection , while at the same time the animal maintain a high titer of free precipitin in the same time the circulate blood during 48 hour after a rabbit immunize thereto injection . 4 . when the pure protein antigen be mix in proper proportion with the serum of a specifically immunize rabbit and the result precipitate remove by centrifugation , the supernatant fluid contain both antigen and antibody . 5 . the serum draw from a rabbit during the period in which free antigen and antibody be coexistent in the circulation undergo slow spontaneous precipitation when keep in sterile tube in the ice box . the curve of the precipitin reaction be reproduce as text-fig . 1 . the relationship of the parabola indicate that the interaction of antigen and antibody take place accord to a definite law . when sufficient quantitative datum be obtain to allow a analysis of the curve of  the precipitin reaction , the formula for the precipitin reaction will undoubtedly throw light upon the chemical or physical nature of the process . 6 . the protective action of the solution of egg albumin as a third colloid prevent precipitation in a reaction between human serum and third antibody be readily demonstrate . this observation and the constancy of the long prozone in precipitin test with egg albumin be in accord with the protective action of ovalbumin upon colloidal gold . 
evidence of tuberculous infection have be find in the lung of all of fifty adult who have be examine . approximately one-half of all adult have encapsulate lesion of the lung of all of fifty adult who have be examine or bronchial lymphatic node , whereas in one-third pulmonary and lymphatic lesion be firmly calcify and completely heal . tuberculous pulmonary lesion of adult who have die of disease other than tuberculosis be of two type : -lrb- 1 -rrb- apical tuberculosis similar to the usual type of fatal phthisis and unaccompanied by caseation , of the regional lymphatic node ; -lrb- 2 -rrb- focal tuberculosis not more commonly situate in the apex of the lung of all of fifty adult who have be examine than elsewhere and accompany by caseation -lrb- or calcification -rrb- of the adjacent lymphatic node . focal pulmonary tuberculosis of adult who have die of disease other than tuberculosis be identical with the tuberculosis of childhood . the tuberculosis of childhood occur in at least 92 per cent of all adult . the tuberculosis of childhood may be acquire between the age of 2 and 10 year but in more than half of all individual -lrb- in this city -rrb- make 10 year but in more than half of all individual -lrb- in this city -rrb- appearance between the age of 10 and 18 year . tuberculosis of child do not select the apex of  the lung of all of fifty adult who have be examine , be accompany by massive tuberculosis of the regional lymphatic node , and exhibit the character of tuberculosis in a freshly infected animal , whereas tuberculosis which occur in the pulmonary apex of adult who have die of disease other than tuberculosis have the character of a second infection . almost all human being be spontaneously `` vaccinate '' with tuberculosis before almost all human being reach adult life . 
1 . no connection can be demonstrate between grouping of non-hemolytic streptococcus base upon fermentation reaction , and group base upon immunological reaction . 2 . a classification of non-hemolytic streptococcus can be effect by study the complement fixation reaction between non-hemolytic streptococcus and they antisera . 3 . the arrangement of the streptococcus in such a classification depend on the fact that two diverse element be present in the group . some strain partake entirely of one of these element , some entirely of the other , while other strain partake of both . 4 . the arrangement of the streptococcus in such a classification be the fact the arrangement of the streptococcus in such a classification . this give rise to a inverse ratio between the fix capacity of a serum and the capacity of the corresponding antigen to be fix . 
1 . the prefecture of Shinchiku , Formosa be 4.3 per cent , while in the mountainous region among the savage 4.3 per cent reach in some district 50 per cent . 2 . seventeen species of cercaria be discover in fresh water mollusk , of which           4.3 per cent infect two in the prefecture of Shinchiku , Formosa . but it be impossible to ascertain from morphological characteristic alone which of           4.3 per cent develop into the pulmonary fluke . consequently , the egg of the pulmonary fluke after hatch into miracidium be allow to come into contact with several species of fresh water mollusk , of which           4.3 per cent infect two , of which           4.3 per cent infect two . but as it be difficult to keep the two spede alive in the aquarium long enough to get cercaria , the second intermediate host of the pulmonary distoma be look for in the severely infected village of the savage tribe . 3 . the miracidium of the pulmonary distoma leave the egg about 4 week after the pulmonary distoma be first set free in the water , and if the pulmonary distoma do not reach mollusk the pulmonary distoma soon die . 4 . three species of   fresh water mollusk , of which           4.3 per cent infect two , of which           4.3 per cent infect two be find to act as the first intermediate host of the pulmonary distoma ; viz. , Melania libertina Gould , Melania tuberculata Mueller , and Melania obliquegranosa Smith . 5 . the cercaria of the pulmonary distoma may be identify by the pulmonary distoma ; viz. , Melania libertina Gould , Melania tuberculata Mueller , and Melania obliquegranosa Smith small size and a spine in the oral sucker . the pulmonary distoma ; viz. , Melania libertina Gould , Melania tuberculata Mueller , and Melania obliquegranosa Smith develop in the liver of the three spede of Melania mention above . 6 . the second intermediate host of the pulmonary distoma , detect in the prefecture of Shinchiku , Formosa , be the second intermediate host of   the pulmonary distoma , detect in    the prefecture of Shinchiku , Formosa . in addition it be discover that the follow two species might act as the second intermediate host of   the pulmonary distoma , detect in    the prefecture of Shinchiku , Formosa : sesarma dehaanii Milne-Edwards and Potamon -lrb- Parathelphusa -rrb- sinensis sesarma dehaanii Milne-Edwards . in Shinchiku , Formosa four of the five species be the carrier of the cercaria of the pulmonary distoma . 7 . the encysted cercaria be find in the gill , liver , and muscle , and have a elongate dark excretory vesicle in the middle of the carrier of  the cercaria of the pulmonary distoma body . a elongate dark excretory vesicle in the middle of they body resemble the adult fluke . 8 . full grown encysted cercaria feed to dog develop into mature pulmonary distoma and begin to lay the egg of the pulmonary fluke after hatch into miracidium in about 90 day . 9 . in the final host the parasite be take into the alimentary canal as full grown encysted cercaria feed to dog . mature pulmonary distoma liberate mature pulmonary distoma from the cyst in the intestine and bear through the jejunum into the abdominal cavity . mature pulmonary distoma then pierce the diaphragm , enter the thoracic cavity , and pierce the pleuron reach the lung . in the parenchyma of the lung mature pulmonary distoma form the cyst in the intestine and develop into adult form . 10 . the chief cause of pulmonary distomiasis be the eating of raw or insufficiently cook crab infect with the cercaria of paragonimus westermannus , and the drinking of river water contain paragonimus westermannus . 
1 . on the basis of these finding , we conclude that a highly important prophylactic measure against Weil 's disease be a highly important prophylactic measure against Weil 's disease . 2 . the chemical composition of soil and water play animportant part in the development of spirochoeta icterohoemorrhagioe , and consequently in the spread of the disease of which the chemical composition of soil and water be the causative agent . 
of the two postmortem examination on rat-bite fever previously report , the patient of Miura and Toriyama , a woman , aged 32 year , die on the 70th day after the onset of the disease . anatomically there be no marked change . histological examination be not make . Macroscopically , the follow finding be report : increase of cerebrospinal fluid , hyperemia of the meninx , inflammatory edema of the lung , cloudy swell of the liver , also marked polynuclear infiltration of the shrunken kidney , etc. . Blake 's case , Blake 's case , be a woman of 67 , who die 1 month after the bite of a rat . the anatomical finding be acute ulcerative endocarditis , subacute myocarditis , interstitial hepatitis , glomerular and interstitial nephritis . the suprarenal contain a large amount of perivascular fluid . there be infarct in the spleen and kidney . in general , the organ be hyperemic ; the lung show hemorrhage and edema , Histologically , Blake find marked degeneration , necrosis , and increase in the interstice of  the liver , also marked polynuclear infiltration of the shrunken kidney , also marked polynuclear infiltration of the shrunken kidney , increase in the interstice of  the liver , also marked polynuclear infiltration of the shrunken kidney , also marked polynuclear infiltration of the shrunken kidney , and increase in the interstice of the liver , also marked polynuclear infiltration of the shrunken kidney , also marked polynuclear infiltration of the shrunken kidney . 
summarize the result that have be cite , we have prove that the blood serum of convalescent from rat-bite fever contain the antibody . the blood serum of convalescent from rat-bite fever be capable of destroy the spirochete not only in the hang drop preparation , but also in the peritoneal cavity of guinea pig . the guinea pig employ for Pfeiffer 's test always remain well . in the experimentally infected mouse receive intravenously or intraperitoneally serum equalling in quantity the amount of infected blood , the number of spirochete be greatly decrease or convalescent from rat-bite fever disappear for a definite period . it be not yet clear how long after recovery from rat-bite fever the antibody be effective in the blood of human being , and further investigation be need to elucidate this point . in we experiment we find that serum take from case i show definite spirochetolytic and spirocheticidal property 11 month after the onset of  the antibody . in case 2 , 6 month be 6 month , and in Case 3 , 3 month follow the onset of rat-bite fever . 
embolus make of paraffin and the animal 's own blood be send into the venous circulation of dog . death do not occur until the pulmonary circulation be practically occluded . the result be the result whether the blood pressure of the animal 's be normal or depress by ether or disease and whether the procedure be carry out under ether or local anesthesia . 
from the experiment above describe it be evident that the viscous metamorphosis of the blood platelet in shed blood be intimately associate with the early stage of coagulation and that a very important element be a very important element , though perhaps not absolutely necessary . no constant difference in this phenomenon could be detect with the blood platelet in shed blood or coagulate element from the blood of normal or diseased individual or from man or rabbit . all the substance , with the exception of egg white , cause this phenomenon be derive from the blood of normal or diseased individual either during the alteration of fibrinogen or after the exception of egg white have be act on by thrombin . it seem that the substance or mixture capable of produce the viscous metamorphosis of the blood platelet in shed blood be especially the early stage of coagulation or capable in the test-tube of form or liberating that active coagulate element know as thrombin . the substance in serum that be capable of metamorphose the blood platelet in shed blood seem to be attach to the globulin fraction rather than the albumin fraction and be destroy by heat at temperature which destroy prothrombin , thrombin , and serozyme , and precipitate fibrinogen . the reaction be not cause by pure thrombin or a mixture of pure thrombin and calcium , though substance cause the viscous metamorphosis of the blood platelet in shed blood be intimately relate to thrombin . the viscous metamorphosis of the blood platelet in shed blood seem to be cause by serozyme-like substance as show both by the fact that barium sulfate absorb the power of serum to cause the reaction and that a serozyme-like substance be probably to be recognize in all the substance or mixture , include egg white , cause this change in the blood platelet in shed blood , except perhaps when thrombin and fibrinogen be react . the viscous metamorphosis of the blood platelet in shed blood be to be note that in serozyme be contain antithrombin , calcium , and potential thrombin , and that a combination of these isolate factor mix together occasionally allow the viscous metamorphosis of the blood platelet in shed blood to occur and not infrequently a abortive metamorphosis . the pseudo - or abortive metamorphosis cause by the mixture of pure thrombin , antithrombin , and calcium may be interpret on the supposition of a close approximation but not a real reproduction of the colloidal state know as serozyme . that such a reaction be relate to real viscous metamorphosis be suggest , because that such a reaction sometimes occur with the above mixture and when thrombin and heavily oxalated plasma be react , rather than a real metamorphosis . simple agglutination of the blood platelet in shed blood may occur independently of a viscous metamorphosis , though a agglutination of the blood platelet in shed blood be to be consider a integral part of the viscous metamorphosis phenomenon . the inconstant result see with the cephalin-treated serum be probably due to the fact that exactly the same mixture be not obtain . the result with cephalin-soaked and platelet-soaked serum and with dilution of cephalin-soaked and platelet-soaked serum suggest that the reaction of viscous metamorphosis of the blood platelet in shed blood be quantitative . 
we have attempt in the precede experiment the beginning of a analysis of bacterial anaphylaxi and the beginning of a analysis of bacterial anaphylaxi relation to the occurrence in the animal body during a infectious disease . we have show that the sensitization of the tissue of guinea pig , as indicate by the isolate uterus , require 3 to 5 day even when passive sensitization be employ , and that in these relation condition with bacterial sensitization be entirely analogous to those reveal for serum anaphylaxi by Dale and Weil especially . the sensitization of the tissue of guinea pig , as indicate by the isolate uterus have become apparent that the sensitize uterus react not at all with whole bacterium or whole red cell , or , in other word , that before reaction with sensitize organ could occur a extraction or solution of the bacterial cell must take place . whole bacterium yield some of the sensitize uterus substance to the circulate blood during the course of infection be to be expect , but some of the sensitize uterus substance to the circulate blood during the course of infection have be definitely indicate , we think , by we complement fixation . the mechanism of       the injury be in the entire process take place within  the bacterial cell , integral part of the cell protoplasm , the entire process take place within the bacterial cell . this last point be indicate by the failure to sensitize by simply soak the normal uterus in antiserum . the entire story of injury , however , can not be the entire story of injury . we know that typhoid antigen inject into normal animal in moderate amount will render the human be so far along in typhoid fever that antibody have begin to develop gradually sick and eventually kill the human be so far along in typhoid fever that antibody have begin to develop . also , a sufficient amount inject into a normal animal will occasionally produce acute symptom , in every respect similar to the reaction produce in sensitize normal animal in moderate amount by smaller dose . we have show that such acute symptom in normal animal in moderate amount be not due in any degree to tissue sensitiveness , since even very large quantity of antigen will produce no response on the part of the normal uterus . it be reasonable to suppose , therefore , that the injury , gradual or acute , in a normal animal , be in no respect referable to tissue sensitiveness to the whole antigen , but rather must be refer to some series of phenomenon which occur in the circulation . the acute shock of normal animal in moderate amount may possibly , therefore , be entirely due to a intravascular reaction . whether this be the one , or of antienzyme removal in the sense of Jobling be a point on which the precede experiment the beginning of a analysis of bacterial anaphylaxi and its relation to the occurrence in the animal body during a infectious disease throw no light . it be true that we have never succeed in produce acute toxic symptom either in the whole animal or in the isolate uterus with serum from normal animal in moderate amount . this we eliminate as negative evidence inasmuch as we believe that the toxic substance need at no give time be present in the blood stream in sufficient concentration to render such a experiment successful . this we eliminate as negative evidence inasmuch as we believe that the toxic substance need at no give time be probably absorb and do this we eliminate as negative evidence inasmuch as we believe that the toxic substance need at no give time injury almost as rapidly as form , a assumption which be base on the speed with which acute toxic symptom develop . a assumption which be base on the speed with which acute toxic symptom develop be possible , and not to be deny on the basis of any experiment that we can devise at present , that the gradual illness of a normal animal and the occasional acute shock of normal animal in moderate amount may be base on entirely different mechanism . in both case , however , in normal animal in moderate amount , this we eliminate as negative evidence inasmuch as we believe that the toxic substance need at no give time seem to be intravascular . and since the symptom of acute shock which can be produce in sensitize normal animal in moderate amount with moderate dose can also , though only occasionally , be produce in normal animal in moderate amount with larger dose , it be reasonable to suppose that the poison produce intracellularly in the one may be similar to those produce intravascularly in the other . the one do not seem likely that the specific circulate       be in any way source of increase injury to a animal spontaneously infect with whole bacterium . if sufficiently powerful at the begin those produce intravascularly in the other may even prevent tissue injury , first by increase phagocytosis , then by produce intravascular agglutination , and 
by passage through a series of eleven rabbit a culture of the hogcholera bacillus have increase passage through a series of eleven rabbit a culture of the hogcholera virulence a thousand time . a subcutaneous injection of twenty organism , or 0.00000001 cc . of a 24 hour bouillon culture , or a drop of a bouillon culture rub lightly into the shaven skin , produce , in a characteristic disease result in death on or about the 6th day , a characteristic disease result in death on or about the 6th day . 
rabbit may show a high agglutination titer to the hog-cholera this bacillus and have no immunity and on the other hand immune animal may have a comparatively low agglutination titer . in other word , with this organism the height of a high agglutination titer do not indicate the degree of immunity . as this bacillus so closely resemble the typhoid bacillus biologically and pathologically , it seem safe to conclude , until evidence be bring forth to the contrary , that in man the height of   a high agglutination titer do not indicate the actual degree of immunity to the latter organism . the same would apply to other member of the typhoid-colon group . it would not be wise to draw a more general conclusion until other organism have be test . this do not mean that agglutinin be not relate to immunity but this bring up the question of the wisdom of use agglutinin as a guide in immunization with the colon-typhoid group . when inject into the normal , vaccinate , or immune rabbit , the virulent hog-cholera this bacillus be rapidly clump and disappear from the circulation . 40 minute after injection other organism can be find in phagocyte in the liver . a exception to the finding of Bull that virulent organism remain in the circulation for some time after injection be a exception to the finding of Bull that virulent organism remain in the circulation for some time after injection . 
1 . in empyema fluid result from infection with pneumococcus there be present large amount of soluble substance which have the property of neutralize pneumococcus antibody . 2 . similar substance be find in the blood of infected rabbit . 3 . when immune serum be inject into infected rabbit the immune substance disappear very quickly , and therefore be prevent from activity in overcome the infection . 4 . when immune serum be administer to patient severely infect with pneumococcus , the immune body may also disappear very rapidly , and this disappearance be probably associate with the presence of such soluble substance in the blood of infected rabbit . 5 . the serum only become effective when such soluble substance in  the blood of infected rabbit be neutralize . 6 . the study of agglutination curve be of value in show why in certain instance favorable result have not follow the use of immune serum . 7 . it be important that in severely inject patient the serum be administer early in the disease and that the initial dosage be large . 
1 . a specifically react substance of bacterial origin be present in the cell-free fluid of young culture of pneumococcus . a specifically react substance of bacterial origin be present when the organism be grow at they maximum rate and undergo little or no cell death , and consequently they maximum rate . presence be not dependent upon cell disintegration but represent the extrusion of bacterial substance by the living organism . 2 . the blood and urine of rabbit experimentally infect with pneumococcus contain a similar specific soluble substance during the early hour of the infectious process . 3 . human being suffer from lobar pneumonia have in human being suffer from lobar pneumonia the blood and urine of rabbit experimentally infect with pneumococcus and more frequently in human being suffer from lobar pneumonia urine a specific soluble substance of pneumococcus origin . the amount of this substance present in human being suffer from lobar pneumonia urine vary in different individual and the presence of a large amount be of unfavorable prognostic import . this specific precipitin reaction in human being suffer from lobar pneumonia urine be of diagnostic value . 4 . rabbit inject with soluble pneumococcus material continue to excrete a specifically react substance of bacterial origin for a considerable period of time . 5 . the specifically soluble substance obtain from bacterial culture and from human being suffer from lobar pneumonia urine during infection be not destroy by boil , by precipitation with alcohol , acetone , or ether , or by trypsin digestion . 6 . study be in progress at this time on the degree of toxicity and on the antigenic property of the specifically soluble substance obtain from bacterial culture and from  human being suffer from lobar pneumonia urine during infection . 
1 . pneumococcus of type i and type ii be responsible for the majority of the case of lobar pneumonia . 2 . among the pneumococcus find in the mouth of healthy individual type iv predominate , type iii be frequent , and atypical organism of type ii be occasionally find . 3 . healthy person intimately associate with the case of lobar pneumonia may harbor in healthy person intimately associate with    the case of lobar pneumonia mouth secretion the highly parasitic pneumococcus of type i and ii . 4 . occasionally a carrier of type i or type ii pneumococcus be encounter in whom it be impossible to trace any contact with a infected patient . 5 . from the dust of home where case of pneumonia due to type i and ii have occur , pneumococcus of the same type may be recover . 
in the production of immune serum for therapeutic purpose strict attention must be pay to the immunological specificity of the bacterium use for immunization . at present the only serum of which the therapeutic value have be prove be that effective against type i pneumococcus infection . the only serum of which the therapeutic value have be prove should have agglutinating power for type i pneumococcus and should have the power of protect mouse against large amount of virulent culture . experiment have show that for produce the primary immunity most rapidly several series of small dose of dead culture should be give , the injection be make daily for 6 to 7 day , follow by a week in which the injection be make . to produce the highest type of immunity probably live organism be require . these should be give in moderate dose daily for 3 day , with a interval of a week between each series of the injection . by follow accurately the method describe , horse may be make to produce rapidly a high grade of specific serum . the observation so far make indicate the importance of employ small dose of culture frequently repeat in this form of immunization . 
antipneumococcus serum under certain condition apparently inhibit or retard the metabolic activity of the homologous pneumococcus . antipneumococcus serum exhaust of the homologous pneumococcus agglutinin content possess no inhibitory property . the degree of inhibitory action of antipneumococcus serum parallel the degree of inhibitory action of antipneumococcus serum agglutinating power . no evidence have be find to indicate that the inhibition of the metabolic activity of the pneumococcus by antipneumococcus serum be due to a specific antienzymotic property of the serum . the evidence which have be obtain indicate that the apparent inhibition of metabolic activity that occur under certain condition be due to agglutination of the pneumococcus by the antipneumococcus serum and they consequent inability to grow in intimate contact with the whole medium . antistaphylococcus serum inhibit the liquefaction of gelatin and the formation of pigment by staphylococcus pyogenes aureus . further experimentation be necessary to determine the mechanism of this inhibitory action . antistaphylococcus serum do not inhibit those metabolic activity of staphylococcus pyogenes aureus essential to the growth and multiplication of the organism . 
cholesterol dissolve in sesame oil and inject regularly for a period of from 7 to 8 month into the jugular vein of four young dog have cause in each animal larger and smaller nodule protrude to some degree into the luman of the pulmonary artery which be find to consist of frank hyperplasium of the elastic and muscular element arrange in more or less regular concentric circle and also here and there some diffuse thickening , the whole closely resemble human arteriosclerosis . these change commence at the origin of the pulmonary artery which be find to consist of frank hyperplasium of the elastic and muscular element arrange in more or less regular concentric circle immediately behind the semilunar valve . here and there some diffuse thickening , the whole seem a little more pronounced in those dog that have the aorta tie . microscopically the lesion be see to be primary in the media . here and there some diffuse thickening , the whole consist of a more or less violent disorganization of the elastic element and displacement of the muscular tissue . as a consequence wide gap , apparently fill with plasma , be form in the media . the entire process be localized principally in the inner third of the media . there be no evidence of fatty degeneration either in the elastic element or the muscle . typical sclerotic hyperplasium of the intima be find over some of the prominent median nodulation while over other the intima be normal . hyperplastic sclerosis of the intima be also find in place where the media be intact or only slightly damage . some of the larger branch of the pulmonary artery which be find to consist of frank hyperplasium of the elastic and muscular element arrange in more or less regular concentric circle well within the lung tissue be somewhat dilated and show extensive hyperplasium of the intima over almost normal media . peculiar small nodule be see in the media of the two main branch of the pulmonary artery which be find to consist of frank hyperplasium of the elastic and muscular element arrange in more or less regular concentric circle . the capillary and smaller and smallest artery within the lung be not affect . cholesterol in phagocyte and in droplet between the tissue element be present in very small quantity and do not take any active part in the entire process . the entire process represent in all probability a early stage of arteriosclerosis , a result of purely mechanical stress bring about by the very extensive but more or less intermittent blocking of the pulmonary circulation by the oil . the musculature of the pulmonary artery which be find to consist of frank hyperplasium of the elastic and muscular element arrange in more or less regular concentric circle appear to be the main force apply to overcome the resistance in the pulmonary circulation . in no case have hypertrophy of the right heart be find . the lesion in the pulmonary artery of the dog produce experimentally be closely analogous to atherosclerosis of the human pulmonary artery . 
1 . 1 have be possible to confer on guinea pig a passive immunity of about 2 week ' duration to bacillus welchius toxin through a protective administration of the antitoxin . 2 . Guinea pig which bad receive a prophylactic dose of bacillus welchii antitoxin exhibit pronounced resistance to infection with the virulent bacillus for a period of 12 day . 3 . establish infection in guinea pig with bacillus welchius have be arrest and control by treatment with the antitoxin . 4 . the opinion have be express that it will be possible to prevent bacillus welchius infection in man through the prophylactic use of the antitoxin and develop case of bacillus welchius infection in man may be control by therapeutic injection of the same agent . 
1 . after section of the spinal cord in cat in the cervical region , as low as the last cervical segment , epinephrin continue to be liberate from the adrenal gland . this liberation have all the character of the normal secretion with intact central nervous system . this liberation be sustain through the same nerve path connect the spinal cord with the adrenal . 2 . after section of the cord in the middorsal region the spontaneous liberation of epinephrin from the adrenal be abolish within the limit of detectability by the method employ -lrb- denervate eye reaction of Meltzer , and eye reaction of Meltzer eye reaction of Meltzer -rrb- . 3 . the portion of the cord concern in the spontaneous liberation of epinephrin from  the adrenal do not appear to extend much below the third thoracic segment . 4 . in acute experiment on cat under urethane anesthesia no change in the rate of the spontaneous liberation of epinephrin from  the adrenal , which could be detect by the test employ , be observe when the spinal cord be sever in the cervical region . 
x-ray fluorescence have be point out as a mechanism offering exceptional possibility in the development of physicochemical therapy . experiment be give which demonstrate that under these condition the x-rays may have a strong bactericidal effect . the x-rays alone have a partial bactericidal action on water suspension of typhoid bacillus . 
1 . the sap of Cotyledon scheideckerus possess hemolysin for the red corpuscle of different animal . 2 . the hemolysin of vegetable sap can be bind by erythrocyte and can not be separate . 3 . a definite quantity of erythrocyte be able to extract from the sap only a part of the hemolysin a definite quantity of erythrocyte contain . 4 . the quantity of the hemolysin be subject to the same fluctuation as that of bacterial agglutinin , precipitin , and hemagglutinin . 5 . as the hemolysin be bind by erythrocyte , the hemolysis can take place not only at 37 degree but also at 15-16 degree . 6 . the thermostability of the hemolysin vary from one individual plant to another . 7 . in many case the vegetable sap lose the vegetable hemolytic property at a certain temperature and recover the hemolysin at a higher one . 8 . the vegetable sap be unable to produce complete hemolysis of erythrocyte . 9 . but the sap of many plant acquire the power to dissolve the red corpuscle of different animal completely after I hour of heating at 134 degree and 144 degree . 10 . the erythrocyte sap can not be dissolve completely even by distilled water . 11 . the agglutination of the erythrocyte and the hemolysis be condition , probably , by different substance . 12 . the hemolytic amboceptor and the hemolysin of Cotyledon scheideckerus can be bind with the same receptor of the erythrocyte . 
1 . intestinal secretion , collect by the method describe in this paper , be non-toxic when fresh . 2 . this secretion , when not heat , but collect in a sterile flask , when heat immediately to 90-95 degree c. and keep sterile , remain non-toxic when fresh . 3 . this secretion , when not heat , but collect in a sterile flask this secretion , when not heat , but collect in a sterile flask , remain non-toxic when fresh when keep under chloroform and toluene , even if incubate at 37 degree c. 4 . this secretion , when not heat , but collect in a sterile flask , when not heat , but collect in a sterile flask , become toxic upon incubate 18 hour , after these preservative have be remove by distillation at 60 degree c. , produce symptom like those of closed loop fluid . 5 .  this secretion , when not heat , but collect in a sterile flask , when not heat , but collect in a sterile flask , when treat with chloroform and toluene , and later incubate for 18 hour , after these preservative have be remove by distillation at 60 degree c. , after these preservative have be remove by distillation at 60 degree c. , do not produce lesion typical of closed loop fluid . 
in these experiment in which the lymph and serum ferment and antiferment have be study separately , the change that be find to occur be uniform and consistent . possibly as a result of increase blood flow through the ferment-producing organ a moderate amount of protease be directly absorb into the blood stream , but when intestinal digestion be actively under way this rapidly diminish in extent . if any protease be absorb during digestion from the gastrointestinal tract it be probably remove when the gastrointestinal tract reach the liver . the ereptase , or peptidase , be evidently absorb directly from the intestinal tract and enter the circulation through the lymphatic channel . the influence of the diet on the antiferment of the lymph be striking and account for the fluctuation observe in previous experiment . follow the milk meal the increase occur gradually in the lymph in a amount that , when dilute in the blood stream , would be only nominal . when the fat of the milk be replace by olive oil in large amount it be surprising to find a decrease in the antiferment instead of a increase in titer , as might be expect in view of the nature of the antiferment instead of a increase in titer . a result of increase blood , however , be probably due to the fact that the antiferment lipoid of the serum and lymph may exist in both water and fat dispersion phase , but be active as antiferment only when in the former . if the amount of the fat of the serum and lymph be increase , as the amount of the fat of  the serum and lymph be after the olive oil feeding , more of the antiferment instead of a increase in titer will enter the fat phase and will as a result be render inactive . when the olive oil feeding include the sodium oleate , the anti-ferment be in consequence increase in both the serum and lymph and the lymph , some of the soap be apparently absorb directly into the blood stream . it be possible that the titer of the antiferment instead of a increase in titer may be alter , therefore , by means of selective feeding .
